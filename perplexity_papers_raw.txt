Unfortunately, the search results do not provide direct access to five specific research papers on fascicular block in myocardial infarction with detailed summaries. However, I can guide you through a structured approach to understanding the topic and highlight relevant information from the available sources.

## 1. **Immediate and Remote Prognostic Significance of Fascicular Block during Acute Myocardial Infarction**
### Authors: Robert A. Waugh, M.D., Galen S. Wagner, M.D., Thomas L. Haney, B.S., Robert A. Rosati, M.D., and James J. Morris, Jr., M.D.
### Journal: Circulation
### Year: 1973

This study analyzed the electrocardiograms of 538 patients with acute myocardial infarction to identify atrioventricular (A-V) and intraventricular (I-V) conduction disturbances. The focus was on the prognostic significance of fascicular blocks in relation to type II A-V block and the risk of syncope or sudden death during the first year of follow-up.

**Methodology:**
- The study involved a retrospective analysis of patients' records to identify conduction disturbances.
- Data on therapy and clinical complications were collected and analyzed for significance.

**Key Findings:**
- The combination of A-V and I-V conduction status was the most accurate predictor for type II A-V block progression and adverse outcomes.
- Patients with acute adjacent fascicular block (e.g., left anterior hemiblock plus right bundle-branch block) and P-R prolongation were at the highest risk (50%) for type II progression.
- Nonadjacent fascicular block also posed a significant risk.

**Clinical Implications:**
- The study highlights the importance of monitoring conduction disturbances in acute myocardial infarction for early identification of high-risk patients.
- It suggests that patients with specific fascicular blocks may benefit from closer monitoring and possibly prophylactic interventions like pacemaker therapy.

## 2. **Acute Myocardial Infarction Associated with Right Bundle Branch Block and Trifascicular Heart Block**
### Authors: Not specified in the search results
### Journal: Journal of Arrhythmia and Other Cardiac Electrophysiological Disorders
### Year: 2019

This case report describes a patient with acute myocardial infarction presenting with right bundle branch block (RBBB) and trifascicular heart block. The patient showed dynamic changes in fascicular blocks, transitioning from left anterior fascicular block to left posterior fascicular block post-streptokinase therapy.

**Methodology:**
- The case involved serial electrocardiographic monitoring and therapeutic interventions like intravenous streptokinase.
- Clinical outcomes were observed and correlated with electrocardiographic changes.

**Key Findings:**
- The patient demonstrated significant clinical improvement with resolution of ST-segment elevations and changes in fascicular blocks post-treatment.
- The presence of RBBB did not mask ST-segment elevations, allowing for diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.

**Clinical Implications:**
- The case highlights the importance of recognizing dynamic conduction disturbances in acute myocardial infarction.
- It emphasizes the role of serial ECG monitoring in managing patients with complex conduction abnormalities.

## 3. **Coronary Angiographic Significance of Left Anterior Fascicular Block during Acute Myocardial Infarction**
### Authors: Not specified in the search results
### Journal: Journal of the American College of Cardiology
### Year: 1985

This study examined the clinical and angiographic significance of left anterior fascicular block (LAH) in patients with acute myocardial infarction. It aimed to determine if LAH was indicative of specific coronary artery involvement or more extensive coronary disease.

**Methodology:**
- The study involved 141 consecutive patients undergoing cardiac catheterization after acute myocardial infarction.
- Angiographic data were compared between patients with and without LAH
