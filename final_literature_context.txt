Title: ST-segment elevation: Differential diagnosis, caveats.

Journal: Cleveland Clinic journal of medicine, Year: 2016

Abstract: The differential diagnosis of ST-segment elevation includes four major processes: ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI); early repolarization; pericarditis; and ST elevation secondary to an abnormality of the QRS complex (left bundle branch block, left ventricular hypertrophy, or preexcitation). Other processes that may be associated with ST elevation include hyperkalemia, pulmonary embolism, and Brugada syndrome. The clinical setting and specific electrocardiographic criteria often allow identification of the cause. This article reviews ST-T and QRS configurations specific to each diagnosis.

The most reliable evidence for diagnosing hemiblocks comes from experimental approaches, clinical cases with intermittent conduction disturbances in the left bundle branch divisions, and aberrant ventricular conduction of premature supraventricular beats. The association of hemiblocks with RBBB provides strong evidence for the trifascicular nature of the intraventricular conduction system.

### Clinical Implications:
- **Diagnosis and Understanding**: The review enhances understanding and diagnosis of fascicular blocks, which are crucial for identifying potential cardiac conditions.
- **Clinical Significance**: Hemiblocks can be markers for underlying cardiac diseases and may influence the interpretation of other electrocardiographic abnormalities.
- **Future Research**: Further studies are needed to fully explore the clinical implications of hemiblocks in various cardiac conditions.

### Authors: Not specified in the search results
### Journal: Journal of Emergency Medicine
### Year: 2012

This article discusses the differential diagnosis of prominent T waves and ST-segment abnormalities in acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Early changes in AMI include hyperacute T waves and non-concave ST segment elevation. The article aims to review tools that help distinguish these ECG patterns from other conditions with similar appearances.

The study presents a case of a 42-year-old woman with minimal cardiac risk factors who developed an ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), illustrating the evolution of early and classic ECG changes associated with her infarct. The article emphasizes the importance of recognizing these patterns early in the disease process to ensure appropriate treatment.

Title: LVH and the diagnosis of STEMI - how should we apply the current guidelines?

Journal: Journal of electrocardiology, Year: 2015

Abstract: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) induces changes in the depolarization and repolarization of the heart that alter the resting electrocardiogram (ECG). These changes include widening of the QRS duration, an increase in the QRS amplitude and secondary changes in the ST segment and T waves. Typically, there is ST segment depression and T wave inversion (or biphasic T waves) in the lateral leads and ST segment elevation (STE) in the precordial leads V1-V3. However, other patterns of ST-T changes may occur. These changes may vary over time and may not necessarily reflect acute ischemia. The ST-T changes secondary to LVH interfere with ECG interpretation and may affect our accuracy in diagnosing STEMI and other forms of active ischemia. The current guidelines specify thresholds for STE in patients without LVH for whom acute reperfusion therapy is indicated; however, there are no such thresholds for patients with LVH.

Title: Immediate and Remote Prognostic Significance of Fascicular Block during Acute Myocardial Infarction

Journal: Circulation, Year: 1973

Abstract: Unfortunately, the search results do not provide direct access to five specific research papers on fascicular block in myocardial infarction with detailed summaries. However, I can guide you through a structured approach to understanding the topic and highlight relevant information from the available sources.

## 1. **Immediate and Remote Prognostic Significance of Fascicular Block during Acute Myocardial Infarction**
### Authors: Robert A. Waugh, M.D., Galen S. Wagner, M.D., Thomas L. Haney, B.S., Robert A. Rosati, M.D., and James J. Morris, Jr., M.D.
### Journal: Circulation
### Year: 1973

This study analyzed the electrocardiograms of 538 patients with acute myocardial infarction to identify atrioventricular (A-V) and intraventricular (I-V) conduction disturbances. The focus was on the prognostic significance of fascicular blocks in relation to type II A-V block and the risk of syncope or sudden death during the first year of follow-up.

**Methodology:**
- The study involved a retrospective analysis of patients' records to identify conduction disturbances.
- Data on therapy and clinical complications were collected and analyzed for significance.

**Key Findings:**
- The combination of A-V and I-V conduction status was the most accurate predictor for type II A-V block progression and adverse outcomes.
- Patients with acute adjacent fascicular block (e.g., left anterior hemiblock plus right bundle-branch block) and P-R prolongation were at the highest risk (50%) for type II progression.
- Nonadjacent fascicular block also posed a significant risk.

**Clinical Implications:**
- The study highlights the importance of monitoring conduction disturbances in acute myocardial infarction for early identification of high-risk patients.
- It suggests that patients with specific fascicular blocks may benefit from closer monitoring and possibly prophylactic interventions like pacemaker therapy.

### Title: Fascicular Blocks: Update 2019

### Year: 2019

This review aims to redefine reliable criteria for the electrocardiographic and vectorcardiographic diagnosis of left fascicular blocks, also known as hemiblocks. The concept of hemiblocks was significantly advanced by the Argentinian School of Electrocardiology, which helped bridge gaps in understanding electrocardiograms that were previously unexplained. The review discusses the anatomy of the left bundle branch and its clinical significance, including the incidence and prevalence of left anterior and left posterior hemiblocks, both isolated and associated with right bundle branch block (RBBB).

The trifascicular nature of the intraventricular conduction system is supported by clinical and experimental observations. The presence of RBBB facilitates the interpretation of these blocks by showing how impulses can follow different pathways within the left ventricle. When the impulse follows the posterior division (due to an anterior block), the axis of the QRS complex shifts superiorly to the left. Conversely, when the impulse follows the anterior division (due to a posterior block), the axis shifts inferiorly to the right.

The review highlights that left anterior hemiblock (LAH) alone or associated with RBBB is common in conditions like coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, and certain degenerative diseases. Experimental studies in animals have supported the concept of hemiblocks by demonstrating "divisional" left bundle branch block and "trifascicular" heart block. These findings have implications for understanding various pathophysiological and electrocardiographic phenomena, including the mechanism of bidirectional tachycardia and the site of origin of ventricular ectopic beats.

The most reliable evidence for diagnosing hemiblocks comes from experimental approaches, clinical cases with intermittent conduction disturbances in the left bundle branch divisions, and aberrant ventricular conduction of premature supraventricular beats.

Title: Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Source: PubMed: Romanian journal of internal medicine = Revue roumaine de medecine interne, 2007 (PMID: 17236292)

Year: 2007

Content: Recently, a novel heart syndrome, mimicking acute coronary syndrome, was described. Patients commonly present with chest pain, ST segment elevation, prolonged QT interval and slight elevation of cardiac enzymes and biomarker levels, despite the absence of significant coronary artery disease. Because of the peculiar left ventricular apical ballooning shape, given by characteristic regional wall motion abnormalities consisting in apical akinesis and basal hyperkinesis, this syndrome was named "Takotsubo" cardiomyopathy, after a round Japanese octopus fishing pot. An episode of emotional or physical stress, including a number of noncardiac illnesses, can be often identified as a trigger. Its unique features include also a strong female predominance and a complete rapid resolution. The management of this syndrome consists mainly in supportive and symptomatic therapy. The evolution, although mainly uneventful, can be complicated, rarely, by left ventricular rupture, making thus the takotsubo cardiomyopathy a newly recognized cause of sudden death. We present some data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical picture and management of this peculiar form of heart disease, which, although easily confounded with an acute coronary syndrome, has emerged as a unique nosologic entity.
