      "disease": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",
      "icd_code": "E11.9",
      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) indicate suboptimal control, consistent with the diagnosis.  A previous A1c of 7.8% further supports this.  The increased fatigue reported could be a symptom of poorly controlled diabetes.  The plan already includes increasing metformin and ordering a new HbA1c."

      "probability": 95,
      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure of 144/88 mmHg is significantly elevated and above the goal of <140/90 mmHg.  This is a clear indication of hypertension. The patient's history includes hypertension, and the plan includes continuing lisinopril and emphasizing lifestyle modifications."

    {
      "disease": "Tension Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches, described as dull and pressure-like, lasting 2-3 hours, and relieved by acetaminophen. This is consistent with tension-type headaches. However, the absence of other neurological symptoms makes other headache types less likely."

  "additional_testing_recommended": [
    "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level:  While the physical exam shows no thyromegaly,  fatigue is a non-specific symptom and TSH should be checked to rule out underlying thyroid issues.  The provided literature highlights the link between thyroid disorders and fatigue.",
    "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): Already ordered, this will help assess renal function given the elevated creatinine and the use of medications that can affect the kidneys.",
    "Complete Blood Count (CBC): Already ordered, this will help evaluate for causes of fatigue, including anemia or infection.",
    "ECG:  While not urgently needed given the normal cardiovascular exam, an ECG would be beneficial to assess for any cardiac abnormalities associated with hypertension."
  ],
  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents with well-established Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension, both requiring ongoing management.  His reported headaches are consistent with tension-type headaches.  The elevated creatinine warrants further investigation with the ordered CMP.  The fatigue warrants further investigation with the ordered CBC and a TSH level to rule out thyroid dysfunction.  Overall, the patient's condition is stable but requires close monitoring and adherence to the treatment plan.",
