      "disease": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",
      "icd_code": "E11.9",
      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) and a previous A1c of 7.8% indicate suboptimal glycemic control.  The patient's fatigue could be a symptom of poorly controlled diabetes.  The elevated creatinine (although the units are incorrect and should be mg/dL, not mgh) warrants further investigation into potential diabetic nephropathy."

    {
      "disease": "Hypertension",
      "icd_code": "I10",
      "probability": 95,
      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure is consistently elevated (144/88 mmHg today, above the goal of <140/90 mmHg).  This, combined with his history of hypertension and current medication (lisinopril), strongly suggests ongoing hypertension."

    {
      "disease": "Tension Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches consistent with tension-type headaches.  However, the absence of other neurological symptoms and the fact that they are only 3/10 in severity makes other causes less likely.  Further investigation is not immediately warranted unless the headaches worsen."
    },

      "disease": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)",
      "icd_code": "N18.9",
      "probability": 40,
      "reasoning": "The elevated creatinine level (assuming the unit is mg/dL, not mgh) suggests potential renal impairment.  This could be related to his diabetes or hypertension, or another underlying condition.  Further investigation is crucial to determine the cause and severity."

  ],
  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents with suboptimally controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and essential hypertension.  The elevated creatinine warrants further investigation into potential chronic kidney disease.  His headaches are likely tension headaches, but require monitoring.  Additional testing is recommended to assess renal function, glycemic control, and lipid profile.  The patient's medications should be reviewed and adjusted based on the results of these tests.",
