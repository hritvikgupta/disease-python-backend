      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) indicate suboptimal control, consistent with the diagnosis.  A previous A1c of 7.8% further supports this.  The increased fatigue reported could be a symptom of poorly controlled diabetes.  The plan already includes increasing metformin and ordering a new HbA1c."

      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated at 144/88 mmHg, exceeding the goal of <140/90 mmHg.  This is a clear indication of hypertension. The patient's history includes hypertension, and the plan includes continuing lisinopril and emphasizing lifestyle modifications."

      "disease": "Tension Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches, described as dull and pressure-like, lasting 2-3 hours, and relieved by acetaminophen. This is consistent with tension-type headaches. However, the absence of other neurological symptoms makes other causes less likely."

    "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels:  While the physical exam shows no thyromegaly,  fatigue is a non-specific symptom that could be related to thyroid dysfunction.  Testing would rule out this possibility.",
    "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): Already ordered, this will assess renal function, particularly important given the elevated creatinine (although the unit is incorrect and needs clarification).",
    "Complete Blood Count (CBC): Already ordered, this will help evaluate the cause of the patient's fatigue.",
    "ECG:  While not urgently needed given the normal cardiovascular exam, an ECG would provide a more complete assessment of cardiac function, especially given the hypertension."

  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, both of which are poorly controlled.  His elevated blood pressure and suboptimal glucose control are the most significant findings.  The reported headaches are consistent with tension-type headaches.  Additional testing is recommended to rule out other potential causes of fatigue and to fully assess renal function given the abnormal creatinine level (unit needs clarification).  The patient's overall condition requires close monitoring and management of his diabetes and hypertension.",
