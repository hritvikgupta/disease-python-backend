      "icd_code": "E11.9",
      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) indicate suboptimal control, consistent with the diagnosis.  A previous A1c of 7.8% further supports this.  The increased fatigue reported could be a symptom of poorly controlled diabetes.  The plan already includes increasing metformin and ordering a new HbA1c."

      "probability": 95,
      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated at 144/88 mmHg, exceeding the goal of <140/90 mmHg.  This is a clear indication of hypertension. The patient's history includes hypertension, and the plan includes continuing lisinopril and emphasizing lifestyle modifications."

    {
      "disease": "Tension Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches, described as dull and pressure-like, lasting 2-3 hours, and relieved by acetaminophen. This is consistent with tension-type headaches. However, the absence of other neurological symptoms makes other headache types less likely."

  "additional_testing_recommended": [
    "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels:  While the physical exam shows no thyromegaly,  fatigue is a non-specific symptom that could be related to thyroid dysfunction.  Testing would rule out this possibility.",
    "Complete metabolic panel (CMP): Already ordered, this will assess renal function, which is crucial given the patient's hypertension and use of medications that can affect the kidneys.  The elevated creatinine warrants close monitoring.",
    "Lipid panel: Already ordered, this will assess lipid levels and guide management of hyperlipidemia.",
    "ECG:  While not urgently needed given the normal cardiovascular exam, an ECG would provide a more complete assessment of cardiac function, especially given the hypertension."

  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents with well-established type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, both requiring ongoing management.  His blood pressure is poorly controlled, and his diabetes management needs improvement.  The reported headaches are consistent with tension-type headaches.  Additional testing is recommended to assess renal function, lipid profile, and thyroid function to ensure comprehensive care and rule out other potential contributing factors to his fatigue.",
