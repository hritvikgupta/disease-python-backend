      "probability": 95,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) and a previous A1c of 7.8% indicate suboptimal glycemic control.  The plan includes increasing metformin and ordering a new HbA1c, confirming the diagnosis and need for management adjustments."

      "disease": "Essential Hypertension",
      "icd_code": "I10",
      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure is consistently elevated (144/88 mmHg today, above the goal of <140/90 mmHg).  This, combined with a history of hypertension and current medication (lisinopril), strongly suggests essential hypertension. The plan includes continuing lisinopril and emphasizing lifestyle modifications."

      "disease": "Tension-type Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 80,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches (2-3 times/week), described as dull, pressure-like pain across the forehead, lasting 2-3 hours and relieved by acetaminophen.  These characteristics are consistent with tension-type headaches.  The absence of neurological symptoms further supports this diagnosis.  However, further investigation might be warranted if headaches worsen or change in character."

      "disease": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)",
      "icd_code": "N18.9",
      "probability": 30,
      "reasoning": "Elevated creatinine (15 mgh - assuming this is a typo and should be in mg/dL, still high) warrants further investigation.  CKD can be a complication of diabetes and hypertension.  A comprehensive metabolic panel is ordered to assess renal function."

      "icd_code": "I15",
      "probability": 20,
      "reasoning": "While essential hypertension is the most likely diagnosis, secondary causes should be considered, especially given the elevated creatinine.  Further investigation is needed to rule out underlying renal or other causes."

Elevated creatinine requires further investigation to rule out chronic kidney disease as a potential complication or contributing factor to his hypertension.  Additional testing is recommended to monitor renal function, assess for anemia (fatigue), and optimize diabetes and hypertension management.  The patient's fatigue warrants further investigation with a CBC.  The plan includes medication adjustments, lifestyle modifications, and regular follow-up.",
