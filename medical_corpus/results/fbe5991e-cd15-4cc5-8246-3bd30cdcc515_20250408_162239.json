      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) indicate suboptimal control, consistent with the diagnosis.  A previous A1c of 7.8% further supports this.  The increased fatigue reported could be a symptom of poorly controlled diabetes.  The plan already includes increasing metformin and ordering a new HbA1c."

      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure is significantly elevated at 144/88 mmHg, exceeding the goal of <140/90 mmHg.  This is a clear indication of hypertension. The patient's history includes hypertension, and the plan includes continuing lisinopril and emphasizing lifestyle modifications."

      "disease": "Tension Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches, described as dull and pressure-like, lasting 2-3 hours, and relieved by acetaminophen. This is consistent with tension-type headaches. However, the absence of other neurological symptoms makes other causes less likely. Further investigation is not immediately warranted given the mild nature and response to OTC analgesics."

  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents with a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  His current presentation confirms suboptimal control of both conditions, evidenced by elevated blood glucose readings and blood pressure.  The reported headaches are consistent with tension-type headaches.  The elevated creatinine warrants further investigation into renal function.  The planned laboratory tests and ECG are appropriate to further assess the patient's condition and guide management.",
