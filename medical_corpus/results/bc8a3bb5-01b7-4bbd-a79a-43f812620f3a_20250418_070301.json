      "reasoning": "The patient's chief complaint is a headache, and the history is non-contributory.  Given the lack of other symptoms,  migraine is a high possibility.  The literature strongly suggests that headaches attributed to sinusitis are often misdiagnosed migraines.  Further investigation is needed to rule out other causes."

      "probability": 60,
      "reasoning": "Tension-type headaches are common and present with a less specific presentation than migraine.  The absence of other symptoms makes this a possible diagnosis, but further investigation is needed to differentiate from migraine."

  "clinical_summary": "A 19-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of headache.  The history is non-contributory.  Based on the limited information, migraine and tension-type headache are the most likely diagnoses.  Allergic rhinitis with headache is a less likely possibility.  Further investigation is crucial to establish a definitive diagnosis and appropriate management.  A detailed history, neurological examination, and potentially allergy testing are recommended.",
