      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) indicate suboptimal control, consistent with the diagnosis.  A previous A1c of 7.8% further supports this.  The increased fatigue reported could be a symptom of poorly controlled diabetes.  The plan already includes increasing metformin and ordering a new HbA1c."

      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure of 144/88 mmHg is significantly elevated and above the goal of <140/90 mmHg.  This is a clear indication of hypertension. The patient's history includes hypertension, and the plan includes continuing lisinopril and emphasizing lifestyle modifications."

      "disease": "Tension Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches described as dull and pressure-like, lasting 2-3 hours, and relieved by acetaminophen. This is consistent with tension-type headaches. However, the absence of other neurological symptoms makes other causes less likely. Further investigation is not warranted at this time unless the headaches worsen."

  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents for follow-up of known type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  His blood pressure is significantly elevated, and his blood glucose control is suboptimal.  He reports occasional tension-type headaches and increased fatigue.  The elevated creatinine warrants further investigation into renal function.  The planned laboratory tests and medication adjustments are appropriate.  An ECG is recommended to fully assess cardiovascular health given the hypertension.",
