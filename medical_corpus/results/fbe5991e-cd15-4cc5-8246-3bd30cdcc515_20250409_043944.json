      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) indicate suboptimal control, consistent with the diagnosis.  A previous A1c of 7.8% further supports this.  The increased fatigue reported could be a symptom of poorly controlled diabetes.  The plan already includes increasing metformin and ordering a new HbA1c."

      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure of 144/88 mmHg is significantly elevated and above the goal of <140/90 mmHg.  This is a clear indication of hypertension. The patient's history includes hypertension, and the plan includes continuing lisinopril and emphasizing lifestyle modifications."

      "disease": "Tension Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches described as dull, pressure-like pain, lasting 2-3 hours, and relieved by acetaminophen. This is consistent with tension-type headaches. However,  the absence of other neurological symptoms makes other headache types less likely."

    "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels:  While the physical exam shows no thyromegaly,  the increased fatigue and occasional dry cough could warrant investigation of thyroid function.  This is especially important given the potential for medication interactions and the prevalence of thyroid disorders.",
    "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): Already ordered, this will help assess renal function given the elevated creatinine and the use of medications that can affect the kidneys.",
    "Complete Blood Count (CBC): Already ordered, this will help evaluate for causes of fatigue, including anemia or infection.",
    "ECG:  While not urgently needed given the normal cardiovascular exam, an ECG would be beneficial to assess for any cardiac abnormalities associated with hypertension."

  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents with well-established Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Hypertension, both requiring ongoing management.  His blood pressure is significantly elevated, and his diabetes control is suboptimal.  His headaches are consistent with tension-type headaches.  Additional testing is recommended to assess thyroid function and rule out other potential causes of his fatigue.  The elevated creatinine warrants close monitoring of renal function.",
