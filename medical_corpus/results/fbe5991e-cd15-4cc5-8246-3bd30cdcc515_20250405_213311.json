    {
      "disease": "Essential Hypertension",
      "icd_code": "I10",
      "probability": 95,
      "reasoning": "The patient's chief complaint includes hypertension, and his blood pressure reading (144/88) is significantly elevated.  This is consistent with the diagnosis of essential hypertension, which is already noted in the assessment and plan.  The physical exam is otherwise unremarkable, supporting the diagnosis of essential hypertension as a primary concern."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",
      "icd_code": "E11.9",
      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) indicate suboptimal control, aligning with the assessment.  The plan includes adjustments to his metformin dosage and ordering an HbA1c to further assess glycemic control."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Tension-type Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 80,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports recurring headaches described as dull, pressure-like pain, lasting 2-3 hours, and relieved by acetaminophen. This aligns with the characteristics of tension-type headaches. The assessment already identifies this as a likely diagnosis.  Absence of neurological deficits further supports this."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) -  Possible",
      "icd_code": "N18.9",
      "probability": 30,
      "reasoning": "The creatinine level is flagged as 'High' in the lab results.  Elevated creatinine can indicate impaired kidney function, a potential complication of both diabetes and hypertension.  Further investigation is needed to determine the cause and severity of the elevated creatinine."

  "additional_testing_recommended": [
    "Complete blood count (CBC) with differential (already ordered, to evaluate fatigue)",
    "Comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) (already ordered, to assess renal function)",
    "HbA1c (already ordered, to assess diabetes control)",
    "Lipid panel (already ordered, to assess hyperlipidemia)",
    "ECG (to assess cardiac function, given hypertension and chest pain risk factor)",
    "Urinalysis (to further evaluate renal function)",
    "Thyroid function tests (TFTs) (to rule out thyroid disorders, given the mention of fatigue and although physical exam was unremarkable for thyromegaly)"
  ],
  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents for follow-up of known type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension.  His blood pressure remains elevated, requiring continued management.  His diabetes control is suboptimal, necessitating medication adjustment.  He reports tension-type headaches, which are manageable with current treatment.  The elevated creatinine warrants further investigation to rule out chronic kidney disease.  Additional testing, as listed above, is recommended to fully assess his overall health and address potential complications of his existing conditions.",
