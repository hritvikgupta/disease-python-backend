      "disease": "Migraine",
      "icd_code": "G43.1",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient's chief complaint is a headache, and there is no other information provided.  Given the age of the patient and the lack of other symptoms, migraine is a high possibility.  The literature extensively discusses the difficulty in differentiating between migraine and sinus headaches, especially those potentially related to allergies.  The absence of other symptoms makes other listed diseases unlikely."

    {
      "disease": "Tension-type headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.2",
      "probability": 25,
      "reasoning": "Tension-type headaches are common, especially in young adults.  The lack of specific symptoms makes this a possible differential, although less likely than migraine without further information."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Sinus Headache (likely secondary to allergic rhinitis)",
      "icd_code": "G44.0",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "While the literature mentions sinus headaches often being misdiagnosed as migraines, the patient's presentation lacks the typical accompanying symptoms of allergic rhinitis (runny nose, congestion, sneezing, itchy eyes).  This is a low probability differential without further information."

  "additional_testing_recommended": [
    "Detailed neurological examination focusing on cranial nerves and assessing for any focal neurological deficits.",
    "Comprehensive allergy testing (skin prick test or blood test) to rule out allergic rhinitis as a potential contributor to headache.",
    "Detailed headache history including frequency, duration, location, character, associated symptoms (nausea, vomiting, photophobia, phonophobia), and any triggers.",
    "Consider imaging (CT or MRI of the head) if neurological examination reveals abnormalities or if headache is severe, persistent, or worsening."
  ],
  "clinical_summary": "A 19-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of headache.  The history is non-contributory.  Given the limited information, migraine is the most likely diagnosis, with tension-type headache as a less likely possibility.  Sinus headache secondary to allergic rhinitis is considered a low probability differential.  Further investigation is crucial to establish a definitive diagnosis and appropriate management.  Additional testing, including a neurological examination, allergy testing, and a detailed headache history, is recommended.  Imaging may be considered depending on the findings of the initial assessment.",
