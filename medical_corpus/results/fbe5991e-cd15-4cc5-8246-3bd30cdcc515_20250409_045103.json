      "icd_code": "E11.9",
      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) indicate suboptimal control, consistent with the diagnosis.  A previous A1c of 7.8% further supports this.  The increased fatigue reported could be a symptom of poorly controlled diabetes.  The plan already includes increasing metformin and ordering a new HbA1c."

      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure of 144/88 mmHg is significantly elevated and above the goal of <140/90 mmHg.  This is a clear indication of hypertension. The patient's history includes hypertension, and the plan includes continuing lisinopril and emphasizing lifestyle modifications."

      "disease": "Tension Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches, described as dull and pressure-like, lasting 2-3 hours, and relieved by acetaminophen. This is consistent with tension-type headaches. However, the absence of other neurological symptoms makes other headache types less likely."

    "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) and free T4 levels:  While the physical exam shows no thyromegaly,  fatigue is a non-specific symptom that could be related to thyroid dysfunction.  Testing would rule out this possibility.",
    "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): Already ordered, this will assess renal function, which is crucial given the patient's hypertension and diabetes, and the high creatinine level (although the unit is incorrect and needs clarification).",
    "Complete Blood Count (CBC): Already ordered, this will help evaluate the cause of the patient's fatigue.",
    "ECG:  While not urgently needed given the normal cardiovascular exam, an ECG would provide a more complete assessment of cardiac function, especially given the hypertension."

  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents with well-established type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, both requiring ongoing management.  His blood pressure is elevated, and his blood glucose control is suboptimal.  He reports occasional tension headaches and increased fatigue.  Additional testing is recommended to rule out thyroid dysfunction and fully assess renal function and the cause of fatigue.  The high creatinine value needs clarification as the unit is incorrect.  Overall, the patient's condition is manageable with medication adjustments and lifestyle modifications.",
