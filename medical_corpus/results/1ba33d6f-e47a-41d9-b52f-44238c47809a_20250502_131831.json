    {
      "disease": "Japanese Encephalitis",
      "icd_code": "A830",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "Given the complete lack of symptoms, vital signs, physical findings, and lab results, the probability of Japanese Encephalitis is extremely low.  This is a serious disease with characteristic symptoms that are entirely absent in this patient."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Campylobacter enteritis",
      "icd_code": "A045",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "Similar to Japanese Encephalitis, the absence of any gastrointestinal symptoms or relevant lab data makes this diagnosis highly improbable."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Hypertension",
      "icd_code": "I10",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "Hypertension requires elevated blood pressure readings, which are missing from the patient data.  The absence of symptoms like shortness of breath or edema further reduces the likelihood."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Infectious mononucleosis, unspecified with polyneuropathy",
      "icd_code": "B27.91",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "The patient shows no signs of fatigue, fever, sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, or neurological deficits.  The key lab values are also missing."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Malignant neoplasm of lateral wall of oropharynx",
      "icd_code": "C102",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "There is no information provided that would suggest an oropharyngeal malignancy.  This diagnosis is purely speculative without any clinical findings."

  "clinical_summary": "The patient, Alice Gaze, is a 0-year-old female with no reported symptoms, vital signs, physical findings, lab values, risk factors, imaging findings, medications, or allergies.  Therefore, no definitive diagnosis can be made.  A complete clinical evaluation is urgently needed to gather essential data for proper assessment and to rule out any potential underlying conditions. The provided medical literature is irrelevant without clinical data.",
