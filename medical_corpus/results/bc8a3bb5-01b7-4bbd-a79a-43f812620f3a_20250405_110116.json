      "reasoning": "The chief complaint is headache, and the patient is a 19-year-old male.  While there is no detailed history, migraine is a common headache type in this age group.  The literature highlights the frequent misdiagnosis of sinus headaches as migraines, and the overlap in symptoms makes it a strong differential.  The lack of information prevents a definitive diagnosis."

      "icd_code": "G44.2",
      "probability": 60,
      "reasoning": "Tension headaches are also very common, especially in young adults.  The absence of specific symptoms makes this a plausible differential.  Further history is needed to differentiate from migraine."

  "clinical_summary": "A 19-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of headache.  The lack of detailed information in the provided patient data prevents a definitive diagnosis.  Migraine and tension-type headache are the most likely differential diagnoses, with headache attributed to rhinosinusitis being a less probable possibility.  Further history, physical examination, and potentially imaging are necessary to reach a conclusive diagnosis and appropriate management plan.",
