      "disease": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus",
      "icd_code": "E11.9",
      "probability": 90,
      "reasoning": "The patient has a 10-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus.  His home glucose readings (120-180 mg/dL) indicate suboptimal control, consistent with the diagnosis.  A previous A1c of 7.8% further supports this.  The increased fatigue reported could be a symptom of poorly controlled diabetes.  The plan already includes increasing metformin and ordering a new HbA1c."

      "reasoning": "The patient's blood pressure of 144/88 mmHg is significantly elevated and above the goal of <140/90 mmHg.  This is clearly documented in the vital signs and assessment. The patient's history includes hypertension, and the plan includes continuing lisinopril and emphasizing lifestyle modifications."

    {
      "disease": "Tension Headache",
      "icd_code": "G44.9",
      "probability": 70,
      "reasoning": "The patient reports occasional mild headaches described as dull and pressure-like, consistent with tension headaches.  The absence of neurological deficits or other concerning features supports this diagnosis. However, further investigation might be warranted if headaches worsen or change in character."

  "additional_testing_recommended": [
    "Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) level:  While the physical exam shows no thyromegaly,  the fatigue could have a thyroid component. TSH would help rule out hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.",
    "Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP): Already ordered, this will assess renal function, which is crucial given the patient's hypertension and diabetes, and the elevated creatinine level (although the unit is incorrect and needs clarification).",
    "Complete Blood Count (CBC): Already ordered, this will help evaluate for causes of fatigue, including anemia.",
    "ECG:  Although noted as unavailable, an ECG is recommended to assess for cardiac involvement related to hypertension.",
    "Clarification on Creatinine Units: The lab report lists creatinine with a value and reference range both in 'mgh', which is not a standard unit.  The unit should be clarified (likely mg/dL) and the result re-evaluated."
  ],
  "clinical_summary": "The patient presents with well-established type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, both requiring ongoing management.  His blood pressure is significantly elevated, and his diabetes control is suboptimal.  Occasional tension headaches are reported, but there are no alarming features.  Additional testing is recommended to investigate the fatigue and clarify the creatinine lab value.  The overall clinical impression is one of manageable chronic conditions requiring close monitoring and adjustments to medication and lifestyle.",
