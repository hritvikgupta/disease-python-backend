    {
      "disease": "Japanese Encephalitis",
      "icd_code": "A830",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "Given the complete lack of symptoms, vital signs, physical findings, and lab results, the probability of Japanese Encephalitis is extremely low.  This is a serious disease with characteristic symptoms that are entirely absent in this patient."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Campylobacter enteritis",
      "icd_code": "A045",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "Similar to Japanese Encephalitis, the absence of any gastrointestinal symptoms or relevant lab data makes this diagnosis highly improbable.  The patient's age also makes this less likely."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Hypertension",
      "icd_code": "I10",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "No blood pressure readings or other indicators of hypertension are present.  This diagnosis is highly unlikely without any supporting data."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Infectious mononucleosis, unspecified with polyneuropathy",
      "icd_code": "B27.91",
      "probability": 5,
      "reasoning": "The patient shows no symptoms of infectious mononucleosis (fever, fatigue, sore throat, lymphadenopathy) or polyneuropathy.  This diagnosis is highly improbable."
    },
    {
      "disease": "Malignant neoplasm of lateral wall of oropharynx",
      "icd_code": "C102",
      "probability": 1,
      "reasoning": "There is absolutely no information to suggest this diagnosis.  It is highly unlikely and requires significant clinical findings to even consider."

A complete clinical evaluation, including a thorough physical examination and basic laboratory tests, is urgently needed to assess the patient's health status and rule out any potential conditions.",
