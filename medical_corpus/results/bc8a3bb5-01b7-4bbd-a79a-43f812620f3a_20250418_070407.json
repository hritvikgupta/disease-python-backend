      "reasoning": "The patient's chief complaint is a headache, and there is no other information provided.  Given the lack of other symptoms,  migraine is a high possibility.  The literature emphasizes the frequent misdiagnosis of sinus headaches as migraines, and the high prevalence of migraine headaches in the population.  The absence of other symptoms makes other listed diseases less likely."

  "clinical_summary": "A 19-year-old male presents with a chief complaint of headache.  The history is non-contributory.  Given the limited information, the most likely differential diagnoses are migraine and tension-type headache.  Further history taking, neurological examination, and potentially allergy testing are recommended to determine the underlying cause of the headache.  Imaging studies may be considered if the headache is persistent or severe.",
