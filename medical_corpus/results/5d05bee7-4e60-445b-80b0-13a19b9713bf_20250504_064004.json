      "icd_code": "A830",
      "probability": 0,
      "reasoning": "The patient data lacks any symptoms, vital signs, physical findings, or lab results.  Therefore, it's impossible to assess the presence of key symptoms like fever, headache, neck stiffness, or positive JEV-specific IgM antibody."

      "disease": "Campylobacter enteritis",
      "icd_code": "A045",
      "probability": 0,
      "reasoning": "Similar to Japanese Encephalitis, the absence of any clinical data prevents evaluation for symptoms like diarrhea, abdominal pain, or a positive stool culture."

      "disease": "Hypertension",
      "icd_code": "I10",
      "probability": 0,
      "reasoning": "No blood pressure readings or other relevant findings (edema, shortness of breath) are available to assess for hypertension."

      "icd_code": "B27.91",

      "icd_code": "C102",
      "probability": 0,
      "reasoning": "No information is provided to suggest or rule out this diagnosis.  The absence of symptoms and findings makes assessment impossible."
