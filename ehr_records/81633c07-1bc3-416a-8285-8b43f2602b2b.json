    "reasoning": "John Doe presents with a constellation of symptoms including tall stature, long limbs, chest pain, and blurred vision at age 35.  While these symptoms individually aren't definitive for any single rare genetic disease, the combination warrants further investigation. The provided literature describes several conditions with overlapping symptoms, particularly in adult-onset cases.  For example, some adult-onset cases of unspecified genetic diseases (as described in the literature) present with symptoms such as weakness, paresthesias, and loss of manual dexterity, which, while not directly matching John Doe's symptoms, highlight the possibility of a progressive neurological condition.  Furthermore, the literature mentions cardiac and ophthalmologic manifestations in several conditions, aligning with John Doe's chest pain and blurred vision.  The tall stature and long limbs are suggestive of Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disorder, which often presents with cardiovascular and ophthalmologic complications.  Given the lack of a detailed family history, the possibility of a de novo mutation cannot be excluded.  Therefore, genetic testing is recommended to explore a broad range of potential genetic disorders, including but not limited to Marfan syndrome and other conditions mentioned in the literature that present with similar symptoms in adulthood.  A comprehensive genetic panel focusing on connective tissue disorders and those with neurological and cardiovascular involvement would be appropriate.",

In most instances death occurs approximately four to six years afer onset [M Escolar, personal communication]. \nInitial manifestations in children older than age six years may be behavioral difculties (attention-defcit/ hyperactivity disorder and mood disorders) followed by motor difculty. Tey ofen decline rapidly soon  afer disease onset [Fiumara et al 2011]. \nSome individuals with onset in adolescence and adulthood present with loss of manual dexterity, burning paresthesias in their extremities, and weakness without intellectual deterioration; others become bedridden and continue to deteriorate mentally and physically [Kolodny et al 1991, Satoh et al 1997, Jardim et al 1999, Wenger 2003]. Presenting manifestations in adult-onset disease can also include unilateral upper-limb weakness and lower-limb hypoesthesia [Debs et al 2013]. Disease progression is generally slower in the adult-onset disease than in adolescent-onset disease. \nTe adult-onset group includes individuals in whom the diagnosis was frst made in adulthood (because the subtle symptoms present earlier in life did not prompt biochemical testing) as well as individuals considered completely normal until manifestations began afer age 20 years [Kolodny et al 1991, Satoh et al 1997, Wenger 2003].

She died of pneumonia at age 73 years. An example of the latter is a woman who developed slowly progressive spastic paraparesis at age 38 years.

THIS ARCHIVAL VERSION IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. \nClinical characteristics \nCongenital fber-type disproportion (CFTD) is usually characterized by hypotonia and mild-to-severe generalized muscle weakness at birth or within the frst year of life. Although some individuals remain nonambulatory throughout life, many eventually develop the ability to walk. In more than $90\\%$ of afecte d individuals, muscle weakness is static or improves; in the remainder it is usually slowly progressive. Mild-tosevere respiratory involvement is seen in approximately $30\\%$ of afected individuals; respiratory failure may occur at any age. Ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and facial and/or bulbar weakness with severe limb/respiratory weakness may predict a poor prognosis. Mild-to-severe feeding difculties occur in nearly $30\\%$ of children. Contractures of the hips, knees, ankles, elbows, and fngers occur in approximately $25\\%$ and may be present at birth or occur in older persons with decreased mobility secondary to severe weakness. Spinal deformities including scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis, and lordosis are seen in $25\\%$ or more of individuals. \nDiagnosis/testing \nDiagnosis is based on a combination of clinical presentation and morphologic features observed on skeletal muscle histology.

There was no history of fever, infection, or trauma, and her medical history was otherwise unremarkable; findings from the previous visit were normal except for a low hemoglobin level and a mildly enlarged spleen. Findings from the physical examination were normal except for a palpable spleen tip and swollen feet. Her feet were tender to palpation, and she would not stand up. Both parents had siblings who died in childhood of infection and others who may have had sickle cell disease. In view of this history and the recurrent painful swelling of her feet, her physician tested C.W. for sickle cell disease by hemoglobin electrophoresis. This test result documented sickle cell hemoglobin, Hb S, in C.W. \nBACKGROUND \nDisease Etiology and Incidence \nSickle cell disease (MIM 603903) is an autosomal recessive disorder of hemoglobin in which the $\\upbeta$ subunit genes have a missense mutation that substitutes valine for glutamic acid at amino acid 6. The disease is most commonly due to homozygosity for the sickle cell mutation, although compound heterozygosity for the sickle allele and a hemoglobin C or a $\\upbeta$ -thalassemia allele can also cause sickle cell disease (see Chapter 11). The prevalence of sickle cell disease varies widely among populations in proportion to past and present exposure to malaria (see Table). The sickle cell mutation appears to confer some resistance to malaria and thus a survival advantage to individuals heterozygous for the mutation. \nPathogenesis \nHemoglobin is composed of four subunits, two $\\upalpha$ subunits encoded by HBA on chromosome 16 and two $\\upbeta$ subunits encoded by the HBB gene on chromosome 11 (see Chapter 11).",

She has visited the ER multiple times and has been hospitalized. An extensive evaluation has failed to yield a diagnosis. The patient does some web research, finding that her symptoms are a match for porphyria. Her conclusion about the diagnosis is reinforced by a \u201curine porphyrin screen\u201d, which reveals a coproporphyrin level that is twice the upper limit of normal. Her physicians agree that the clinical picture and lab findings are consistent with acute porphyria, specifically HCP. They proceed to manage her pain episodes with opiates, glucose infusion, and intravenous hematin. The results are variable and often unimpressive.  Symptom relief, when achieved, is of short duration \u2013 hours to a few days only. Overall the attacks become more frequent, to the point that pain is present on most days. Her use of opiates escalates, raising questions of narcotic dependence. She pursues a high-carbohydrate diet, having read that this may preempt symptoms in porphyria, and gains 90 lb. She is unable to work. She is referred to a porphyria specialist, who obtains genetic testing. The results are negative for any form of acute porphyria. \nThe history illustrates that misdiagnosis of HCP can have life-altering consequences. ",

People with Marfan syndrome have a $50\\%$ chance of passing the mutation on each time they have a child. \nPeople are born with Marfan syndrome but may not notice any features until later in life. Marfan syndrome features can appear at any age, including in infants and young children. They often get worse as people age. \n3. WHAT IS THE PROGNOSIS FOR PEOPLE WITH MARFAN SYNDROME? \nThere is no cure for Marfan syndrome, but with early diagnosis, proper treatment and careful management of the disorder, it is possible for people to live a normal life span. The outlook today for people with Marfan syndrome is far brighter than it was a few decades ago. In the days before open-heart surgery, the average life expectancy was reduced by a third. Now, early diagnosis and careful management have greatly improved the prognosis and increased life expectancy. Medical and surgical treatments continue to improve and offer hope to even the most severely affected infants, children and adults. In addition, proper management can relieve or prevent many of the complications that interfere with daily activities. \n1.HOW IS MARFAN SYNDROME DIAGNOSED? \nAlthough scientists have determined that Marfan syndrome is caused by a variation in the fibrillin-1 gene on chromosome 15, there is no simple test that can conclusively diagnose Marfan syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is made primarily through a clinical evaluation. Genetic testing may be helpful in some situations (see page 22). \nBecause most features of Marfan syndrome progress with age, the diagnosis is often more obvious in teens or adults. But children, even newborns, can and should be examined. For these reasons, the diagnostic evaluation should be performed by physicians experienced with the condition. The evaluation should include: \nA detailed medical and family history.   \nA complete physical examination.   \nA thorough eye examination by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) using a slit lamp to look for lens dislocation after fully dilating the pupil.   \nAn electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiogram to look for involvement of the cardiovascular system that may be not evident from the physical examination. \n",

El Chehadeh-Djebbar et al [2011] \nClinical Characteristics \nClinical Description \nPhenotypic features of Cohen syndrome among the more than 200 afected individuals reported to date are variable and include progressive retinochoroidal dystrophy and myopia, acquired microcephaly, developmental delay, hypotonia, joint laxity, characteristic facial features, truncal obesity, cheerful disposition, and neutropenia. \nNote: Certain statistics presented here are from National Cohen Syndrome Database (NCSD) in which approximately $50\\%$ of individuals are Old Order Amish; the diagnosis of Cohen syndrome has been confrme d by molecular genetic testing in the vast majority of individuals. \nOphthalmologic. Individuals with Cohen syndrome had a frst ophthalmologic visit and were prescribed their frst pair of glasses at an average age of 4.5 years. Defective dark adaptation/night blindness (nyctalopia) was typically noticed afer age seven years. However, studies of younger individuals with Cohen syndrome demonstrate that abnormal retinal fndings and ERG changes are present much earlier in life [Kivitie-Kallio et al 2000, Chandler et al 2002].",

At conception, each sib of an afecte d individual has a $25\\%$ chance of being afected, a $50\\%$ chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a $25\\%$ chance of being unafected and not a carrier. When the ALMS1 pathogenic variants have been identifed in an afecte d family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. \nDiagnosis \nSuggestive Findings \nAlstr\u00f6m syndrome should be suspected in individuals with the following clinical fndings that evolve as afecte d individuals age [Marshall et al 2005]: \n\u2022 Cone-rod dystrophy with decreased vision and secondary nystagmus and photodysphoria (light sensitivity / photophobia) usually within the frst year of life.

Six of the seven died of respiratory failure within the frst few months of life. One male walked at age 17 months and developed mild dilated cardiomyopathy at age 3.5 years. Some female carriers had mild myopathic signs [Clarke et al 2005]. \nA Japanese girl with deletion 1p36, developmental delay, dysmorphic features, and hypotonia had CFTD on muscle biopsy, suggesting that a gene involved in CFTD may exist at this locus [Okamoto et al 2002]. SELENON, the gene encoding selenoprotein N and implicated in CFTD and multiminicore disease, resides in this region; however, inheritance of the myopathy associated with SELENON alterations is autosomal recessive. \nVorwerk et al [1999] described two brothers with CFTD and insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus who were compound heterozygotes for alterations in the insulin receptor gene $(I R;I N S R)$ . A third brother who did not inherit either INSR gene alteration did not develop symptoms of CFTD, suggesting a potential association between the mutation of INSR and CFTD [Vorwerk et al 1999]. \n2.

Heterozygous pathogenic missense variants were observed in $6\\%$ of individuals with CFTD in one series [Laing et al 2004] and have been reported in at least seven families [Laing et al 2009]. \n4. Sequence analysis detects variants that are benign, likely benign, of uncertain signifcance, likely pathogenic, or pathogenic. Pathogenic variants may include small intragenic deletions/insertions and missense, nonsense, and splice site variants; typically, exon or whole-gene deletions/duplications are not detected.
