IF YOU SUSPECT MARFAN SYNDROME \nIf you suspect that you or a family member may have Marfan syndrome, find a doctor who is knowledgeable about the condition. Ideally, the diagnostic process should be coordinated by a medical geneticist (a doctor who specializes in genetic conditions such as Marfan syndrome). A second choice is a cardiologist (heart doctor). Make sure the cardiologist has treated people who have Marfan syndrome. You can find a doctor by: \nAsking your primary doctor for a referral   \nCalling the doctor referral service at your local   \nhospital   \nCalling your insurance provider   \nCalling our help center at 800-8MARFAN \nYou should also compile a health history for you and your family, recording: \nPast illnesses, operations, and hospitalizations   \nMedications   \nReasons you think you or your family member might   \nhave Marfan syndrome   \nFamily members who have, or might have, Marfan   \nsyndrome   \nFamily members who died of a heart or vascular   \nproblem; it is also important to understand the   \nnature or cause of the problem \nThe Role of Heredity \nWe each have two copies of most genes in each of our cells but when we have children we transmit only one copy. For disorders in which a mutation or change in one copy of a gene is sufficient to produce a clinical condition, the resulting disorder is referred to as a dominant disorder. Marfan syndrome is a dominant disorder in which one copy of the FBN1 gene has a mutation that affects the function of the protein, fibrillin-1, produced under the direction of the gene. In the situation in which one parent has the disorder, the altered copy of the gene can be inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an affected individual has a $50\\%$ chance to inherit the mutated copy and develop Marfan syndrome. If they inherit the normal copy from their affected parent, then they are not at risk to develop Marfan syndrome and, equally important, cannot pass that altered copy to their own children.",

The clinical manifestations of HCM range from asymptomatic to progressive heart failure to sudden cardiac death and vary from individual to individual even within the same family. Common symptoms include shortness of breath (particularly with exertion), chest pain, palpitations, orthostasis, presyncope, and syncope. Most often the LVH of HCM becomes apparent during adolescence or young adulthood, although it may also develop late in life, in infancy, or in childhood. \n\nManagement \nBefore identification of the genes responsible for HCM, diagnosis of HCM could only be made through integration of examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and invasive angiographic/hemodynamic studies, disproportionately identifying patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction. Genetic testing for HCM is now available and can provide important insights into family management by definitively identifying at-risk relatives (i.e., those who have inherited the family\u2019s pathogenic mutation). Mutations found are considered pathogenic based on the following criteria: (1) cosegregation with the HCM phenotype in family members; (2) previously reported or identified as a cause of HCM; (3) absent from unrelated and ethnic-matched normal controls; (4) important alteration in protein structure and function; and (5) amino acid sequence change in a region of the protein otherwise highly conserved through evolution. However, even with the use of these criteria, a considerable number of variants are classified as VUSs (see Chapter 16), making the test results ambiguous. \nBecause diagnosis and sudden cardiac death risk are both linked to the presence of LVH and because the penetrance of LVH is age-dependent, clinical evaluation must continue longitudinally. Screening is annual during adolescence and early adulthood when LVH most commonly emerges. Early childhood screening is appropriate if there is a family history of early-onset disease or other concerns. During adulthood, screening is recommended approximately every $5$ years or in response to clinical changes because LVH can develop late in life.",

When IMH is present, the extent and thickness of the hematoma can be documented and, when PAUs are present, the presence of and size of pseudoaneurysms can be easily defined. \n\n2. In general, the choice of the initial imaging modality should be based on the patient\u2019s history and clinical presentation, the specific clinical questions to be answered, and the institutional availability, experience, and expertise with each of the diagnostic imaging techniques.6 In certain clinical circumstances, for example, patients with a history of an iodinated contrast reaction or patients who are too unstable to travel to the radiology suite, CT may not be preferred. Echocardiography (TEE/ TTE) is an alternative. TTE is noninvasive, can be performed at the bedside, and may be helpful in eliciting the diagnosis of AAS and quickly identifying complications of AAS, such as AR or pericardial effusion and tamponade. TEE is preferred to TTE, however, because of its higher sensitivity and better anatomic resolution; TEE can be performed at the bedside in the emergency department or, alternatively, once the patient is in the operating room. MRI is most commonly the third-choice modality, given that it is not readily available, requires skilled interpretation, and has longer acquisition times, as well as the fact it is challenging to provide clinical care to potentially unstable patients while in an MRI scanner. Consequently, MRI is most often used as a follow-up imaging modality in patients in which there is diagnostic uncertainty. Nevertheless, MRI may be the study of choice in the acute setting for a stable patient with a contraindication to iodinated contrast. \n\n7.3. Medical Management of AAS \nSynopsis \nPatients presenting with AAS need to be treated promptly to prevent acute and chronic complications. In all patients with AAS, immediate medical therapy is indicated while considering urgent surgical (in patients with type A aortic dissection), endovascular intervention (in patients with type B aortic dissection), or both; medical therapy includes aggressive heart rate and BP management as well as pain control.",

Nevertheless, the risk of an adverse outcome to the fetus from anti-seizure medication exposure is ofen less than that associated with exposure to an untreated maternal seizure disorder. Terefore, use of anti-seizure medication to treat a maternal seizure disorder during pregnancy is typically recommended. Discussion of the risks and benefts of using a given anti-seizure drug during pregnancy should ideally take place prior to conception.

Talk to your doctor to decide what is most important to include on your bracelet. \n\nvii. Contact Your Primary Care Doctor \nProvide emergency department staff with the patient\u2019s primary care physician\u2019s name and phone number. Ask them to call at once for any additional information that may be needed for appropriate treatment. \nviii. Be Familiar with Tests that Confirm or Rule Out a Diagnosis of Aortic Dissection \nThe diagnostic test used to confirm aortic dissection should be that test which the specific institution can perform in the most timely and accurate manner. This is usually a CT scan of the chest with IV contrast or a transesophageal echocardiogram. An MRI is occasionally used as a first test. If the patient has an allergy to IV dye, shellfish or Iodine, this should be mentioned to the emergency department personnel. It is important to remember that a chest x-ray may not show an aortic dissection and, if dissection is suspected, a normal chest x-ray should not deter further evaluation. \n",

      "contents": "96 There was approximately a $20\\%$ difference in incidence between AR and AD WMS for microspherophakia and cardiac anomalies (more prevalent in AR WMS) as well as joint limitations and ectopia lentis (more prevalent in AD WMS),97 although these characteristics are commonly seen in both forms of WMS. Further complicating differentiation between AR and AD WMS based on family history, some heterozygotes for AR WMS display mild clinical manifestations of the disease, including short stature, brachydactyly, and abnormal gonioscopic findings. In addition to the eye manifestations listed in Table 2 (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/GIM/A112), shallow orbits and glaucoma can be features of WMS. Congenital cardiac abnormalities reported for patients with WMS include MVP, prolonged QT interval, and pulmonary and aortic valve stenoses. Patients with WMS and a history of palpitation, lightheadedness, dizziness or syncope should be evaluated for prolonged QTc, as it may be associated with serious arrhythmia.98 The differential diagnosis of WMS includes Hunter-MacDonald Syndrome.99 \n\nDISCUSSION \nThe cornerstones for establishing a diagnosis are a personal medical history, a family history extended through third-degree relatives, and a comprehensive genetics physical examination, with special attention to potential dysmorphic features, cardiac murmurs, body proportions, joint mobility, and skin characteristics. This article is meant to help guide the development of an informed differential diagnosis and suggest possible targets for further clinical evaluation and genetic testing. Considerations for specific testing in heritable disorders of connective tissue may include the following: \n\u25cf Evaluation by an ophthalmologist with knowledge of disorders of connective tissue to assess abnormalities of the lens, retina, vitreous, and refraction.   \n\u25cf Radiographic imaging, including transthoracic or esophageal echocardiography, with careful, serial measurements of the aortic root at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva to compare with normal references for age and/or body mass index and evaluation of the aortic arch.   \n\u25cf CT or MR angiogram of the cerebral, neck, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic arteries.",

      "contents": " Note: Tere may not be clinical trials for this disorder. \nGenetic Counseling \nGenetic counseling is the process of providing individuals and families with information on the nature, mode(s) of inheritance, and implications of genetic disorders to help them make informed medical and personal decisions.  Te following section deals with genetic risk assessment and the use of family history and genetic testing to clarify genetic status for family members; it is not meant to address all personal, cultural, or ethical issues that may arise or to substitute for consultation with a genetics professional. \u2014ED. \nMode of Inheritance \nGreig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS) is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is caused by either a pathogenic variant involving GLI3 or a deletion of chromosome 7p14.1 involving GLI3. \nBalanced chromosome rearrangement. If the causative genetic alteration in the proband is a deletion of chromosome 7p14.1 [Schulz et al 2008], the parents of the proband are at risk of having a balanced chromosome rearrangement and should be ofered chromosome analysis. If a parent has a balanced structural chromosome rearrangement, the risk to sibs is increased and depends on the specifc chromosome rearrangement and the possibility of other variables. \nRisk to Family Members \nParents of a proband \n\u2022 Some individuals diagnosed with GCPS have the disorder as the result of a genetic alteration inherited from a parent.   \n\u2022 Some individuals diagnosed with GCPS have the disorder as the result of a de novo GCPS-causing genetic alteration. Te proportion of individuals with GCPS caused by de novo genetic alteration is unknown, as the frequency of subtle signs of the disorder in parents has not been thoroughly evaluated and molecular genetic data are insufcient.   \n\u2022 Recommendations for the evaluation of parents of a child with GCPS and no known family history of GCPS consist of clinical examination and radiographs of hands and feet unless physical signs suggest the need for other studies (e.g., neuroimaging for possible hydrocephalus in a parent). Molecular genetic testing of the parents is indicated if the GCPS-causing genetic alteration has been identifed in the proband.   \n",
