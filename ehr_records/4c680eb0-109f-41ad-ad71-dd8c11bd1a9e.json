The QRS complexes are narrow, which is consistent with a normal ventricular depolarization.\n* **Lead II:** Similar to Lead I, the P waves are slightly peaked and the QRS complexes are narrow.\n* **Lead III:**  Similar to Leads I and II \u2013 P waves are slightly peaked, QRS complexes are narrow.\n* **Lead aVR:**  The P waves are inverted, suggesting right atrial activity is being attenuated. The QRS complexes are normal.\n* **Lead aVL:**  The P waves are normal in morphology. The QRS complexes are normal.\n* **V1-V6:** This is where we see the most significant abnormalities.\n    * **ST-segment Depression:** There's prominent ST-segment depression in leads V2-V4.

  "recommendation": "Myocardial Ischemia",
  "reasoning": "The ECG shows prominent ST-segment depression in leads V2-V4, accompanied by flattened and slightly inverted T-waves in the same leads. This pattern is highly suggestive of myocardial ischemia, indicating a lack of blood flow to a portion of the heart muscle, most likely in the septal region.  The slightly peaked P waves suggest possible left atrial enlargement or increased pressure, which could be a consequence of the ischemia or an independent finding. While early repolarization and pericarditis are considered in the differential, the severity and location of the ST-segment depression strongly favor myocardial ischemia as the primary diagnosis. The patient's chief complaint of headache could be related to the underlying cardiac issue, although further investigation is needed to establish a direct link.\n\nDifferential Diagnoses:\n- {'diagnosis': 'Early Repolarization', 'explanation': 'While the ECG shows ST-segment depression, the pattern and severity make early repolarization less likely than myocardial ischemia. Early repolarization typically presents with less prominent and more diffuse ST-segment depression.'}\n- {'diagnosis': 'Pericarditis', 'explanation': 'Pericarditis can cause ST-segment elevation, but the pattern of ST-segment depression in leads V2-V4 is more consistent with myocardial ischemia.  Further investigation would be needed to rule this out.'}\n- {'diagnosis': 'Benign ECG Variant', 'explanation': \"It's possible that the ECG findings represent a benign variant, however, the significant ST-segment depression in leads V2-V4 warrants further investigation to rule out serious pathology.\"}",
