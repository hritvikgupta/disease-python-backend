Reports chest pain starting this morning, calling it a sharp, stabbing feeling on the left side, coming and going every 5-10 minutes. Says it\u2019s annoying as hell but denies shortness of breath, puking, or sweating. No recent bangs or bruises. No allergies or meds he\u2019s on.\n\nO (Objective):\n\nVitals (made up): BP 118/76 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, RR 14 breaths/min, Temp 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), SpO2 99% on room air.\n\nLooks fine\u2014awake, knows where he is, not freaking out.\n\nA (Assessment):\n\nGuess: Chest pain, no clue why yet\u2014maybe his ribs are pissed off, or could be his heart acting up, though he\u2019s young for that shit.

Tell him to chill out, no heavy lifting or running around. Throw him some ibuprofen, 400 mg if it\u2019s just sore muscles. Check back in a day or two, or sooner if it gets worse. Tell him if it feels like an elephant\u2019s sitting on his chest or he can\u2019t breathe, haul ass to the ER.\n\n--- IMAGING & SCANS ---\n- ECG (3/25/2025): ECG Scan for Patient\n\n--- IMAGING & SCANS ANALYSIS ---\n\n[Scan 1: ECG (2025-03-25T09:09:28.833517)]\nFile: norm.png\nDescription: ECG Scan for Patient\nAnalysis: Okay, let's analyze this ECG tracing in detail. Here's a breakdown of what I observe, focusing on potential abnormalities and relevant observations:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe ECG shows a sinus rhythm, but with some concerning features that warrant further investigation.  The rate appears to be within the normal range (approximately 60-100 bpm based on the R-R intervals), but there are several changes that suggest underlying cardiac pathology. \n\n**Detailed Observations:**\n\n1. **Rate:** The heart rate appears to be approximately 70-75 bpm.  The R-R intervals are relatively consistent, suggesting a regular rhythm.\n\n2. **P Waves:** The P waves are present and appear generally normal in morphology. They are upright in leads I, II, aVF, and V1-V6, which is consistent with a normal sinus rhythm. However, their amplitude is slightly reduced in some leads, which could indicate underlying conduction abnormalities.\n\n3. **PR Interval:** The PR intervals are normal in duration (approximately 0.16-0.20 seconds).\n\n4. **QRS Complex:** This is where we see the most significant abnormalities.\n   * **Width:** The QRS complexes are widened, particularly in leads V1, V2, V5, and V6. This widening suggests a delay in ventricular depolarization, which could be due to several factors.\n   * **Morphology:**  The QRS complexes appear notched and slurred in V1 and V2, suggestive of left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) or left bundle branch block (LBBB). The Q waves are present and prominent in some leads, which could be indicative of prior myocardial infarction. \n   * **Amplitude:** The QRS amplitude is somewhat reduced in some leads, particularly V1-V3. \n\n5. **ST Segment & T Waves:**\n   * **ST Segment:** The ST segments are depressed in leads V4-V6, and slightly depressed in leads I and aVL. This depression is concerning and could indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction.\n   * **T Waves:** The T waves are inverted in leads V1-V3, and inverted in leads I and aVL. This is consistent with the ST segment depression and further supports the possibility of myocardial ischemia.\n\n6. **Axis:** The overall QRS axis appears to be left-axis deviation, which is consistent with LAFB or LBBB. \n\n7.\n\n\n--- MEDICAL ENTITY ANALYSIS ---\n\nDETAILED_DESCRIPTION: 2006-02-16, sharp, stabbing, going, room air, elephant, sitting, leads I, II, aVF, and V1-V6, leads, ,, -V3, leads V4-V6, I and aVL, leads V1-V3, leads I and aVL\nSIGN_SYMPTOM: headache, Pain, pain, shortness of breath, puking, sweating, bangs, bruises, awake, freaking out, sore, s, can, t breathe, delay, depolarization, slurred, Q waves, depressed, T waves\nBIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE: Chest, chest, left side, ribs, ticker, lungs, muscles, leads V1, V2, V5, V6, V1 and V2, V1\nHISTORY: history of illness, allergies or meds, s on, knows where, is, heavy lifting, running\nDURATION: morning, day\nLAB_VALUE: and, 118/76 mmHg, 70 bpm, 14 breaths/min, 98.7\u00b0F, 99%, sinus rhythm, normal range, 60, 100 bpm, 70-75 bpm, consistent, regular, normal, upright, slightly reduced, 0., -, seconds, widened, notched, somewhat, reduced, slightly depressed, inverted, left-axis deviation\nDISTANCE: 5-10 minutes, 16, 0.20\nDIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE: Vitals, BP, HR, RR, Temp, SpO2, ECG, X-ray, rate, -R, heart rate, R-R intervals, P Waves, P waves, amplitude, PR Interval, PR intervals, QRS Complex, QRS complexes, ventricular, itude, QRS amplitude, ST Segment, T Waves, ST segments, leads, QRS axis\nDISEASE_DISORDER: off, heart, up, stress, cardiac pathology, conduction abnormalities, left anterior fascicular block, LAFB, left bundle branch block, LBBB, myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, infarction, depression\nTHERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE: out\nMEDICATION: ibuprofen\nDOSAGE: 400 mg\nDATE: or two, 3/25/2025, 2025-03-25, 09:09:28\nNONBIOLOGICAL_LOCATION: ER",

  "reasoning": "The ECG shows concerning features suggestive of underlying cardiac pathology.  Specifically, the widened QRS complexes, notched and slurred QRS complexes in V1 and V2 (suggestive of left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) or left bundle branch block (LBBB)), ST segment depression in leads V4-V6 and I and aVL, and inverted T waves in leads V1-V3 and I and aVL are highly concerning and could indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction.  Given Steven's age (19 years old at the time of the ECG), the presence of these abnormalities warrants immediate and thorough investigation.  While the chest pain could have benign causes, the ECG findings significantly raise the suspicion of a serious underlying cardiac condition.  Several rare genetic diseases, such as Salih myopathy, Brugada syndrome, and Long QT syndrome (LQTS), present with similar ECG abnormalities and can lead to sudden cardiac death, especially in young individuals.  The literature highlights the importance of early diagnosis and intervention in these conditions.  Therefore, genetic testing is strongly recommended to identify a potential underlying genetic cause for Steven's ECG findings and chest pain.  Further investigations, such as a cardiac MRI, should also be considered.",

TdP is \nusually self-terminating and may cause palpitations, dizziness, or syncope, the most common symptom in individuals with LQTS. Syncope is typically precipitous and without warning. A careful evaluation of medical history can help distinguish LQTS-associated syncope from common vasovagal and orthostatic forms of syncope in which presyncope and other warning symptoms occur. Absence of aura, incontinence, and postictal fndings help diferentiate LQTS-associated syncope from seizures. Te number of syncopal events in symptomatic individuals ranges from one to hundreds, averaging just a few. In some instances, TdP degenerates to ventricular fbrillation and aborted cardiac arrest (if the individual is defbrillated) or sudden death. \nCardiac events (i.e., syncope, cardiac arrest, or sudden cardiac death) may occur from infancy through middle age but are most common from the preteen years through the 20s, with the risk generally diminishing throughout that time period. Te usual age range of events difers somewhat for each genotype.

      "contents": "LQT syndrome is caused by repolarization defects in cardiac cells. Repolarization is a controlled process that requires a balance between inward currents of sodium and calcium and outward currents of potassium. Imbalances cause the action potential of cells to increase or decrease in duration, causing elongation or shortening, respectively, of the QT interval on electrocardiography. Most cases of LQT syndrome are caused by loss-of-function mutations in genes that encode subunits or regulatory proteins for potassium channels (genes whose names begin with KCN). These mutations decrease the outward, repolarization current, thereby prolonging the action potential of the cell and lowering the threshold for another depolarization. In other LQT syndrome patients, gain-of-function mutations in a sodium channel gene, SCN5A, lead to an increased influx of sodium, resulting in similar shifting of action potential and repolarization effects. \nPhenotype and Natural History \nThe LQT syndromes are characterized by elongated QT interval and T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiography (Fig. C-28), including tachyarrhythmia and torsades de pointes, a ventricular tachycardia characterized by a change in amplitude and twisting of the QRS complex. Torsades de pointes is associated with a prolonged QT interval and typically stops spontaneously but may persist and worsen to ventricular fibrillation. \n\nIn the most common LQT syndrome, Romano-Ward, syncope due to cardiac arrhythmia is the most frequent symptom; if undiagnosed or left untreated, it recurs and can be fatal in $10\\%$ to $\\bar{1}5\\%$ of cases. However, between $30\\%$ and $50\\%$ of individuals with the syndrome never show syncopal symptoms. Cardiac episodes are most frequent from the preteen years through the 20s, with the risk decreasing over time. Episodes may occur at any age when triggered by QTprolonging medications (see list at http://www.qtdrugs.org). Nonpharmacological triggers for cardiac events in the Romano-Ward syndrome differ on the basis of the gene responsible.

All rights reserved. \npathophysiology of NMH involves reduced venous return, which then initiates a series of neural responses that result in withdrawal of sympathetic tone and a relatively unopposed vagal response. These responses lead to slowing of the heart rate and vasodilation, which can result ultimately in a profound drop in blood pressure or syncope if the individual remains upright. Markedly elevated epinephrine levels are present prior to syncope (Benditt et al., 2003; Jardine et al., 1997). Precipitating factors for NHM can include prolonged standing; warm environments (such as hot weather, hot showers, or hot tubs); pain; venipuncture; the sight of blood; or sudden stretching of mechanoreceptors in the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and lungs. These phenomena can occur individually or in combination (Grubb, 2005; Jhanjee et al., 2009; van Lieshout et al., 1991; Wieling et al., 2004). Although many patients with NMH experience only isolated episodes of syncope that are separated by long periods of normal function, NMH physiology can be associated with chronic, daily orthostatic symptoms. Patients referred for evaluation of recurrent syncope report chronic fatigue, as well as impaired quality of life (Kenney and Graham, 2001; Legge et al., 2008; Rose et al., 2000).",

She has visited the ER multiple times and has been hospitalized. An extensive evaluation has failed to yield a diagnosis. The patient does some web research, finding that her symptoms are a match for porphyria. Her conclusion about the diagnosis is reinforced by a \u201curine porphyrin screen\u201d, which reveals a coproporphyrin level that is twice the upper limit of normal. Her physicians agree that the clinical picture and lab findings are consistent with acute porphyria, specifically HCP. They proceed to manage her pain episodes with opiates, glucose infusion, and intravenous hematin. The results are variable and often unimpressive.  Symptom relief, when achieved, is of short duration \u2013 hours to a few days only. Overall the attacks become more frequent, to the point that pain is present on most days. Her use of opiates escalates, raising questions of narcotic dependence. She pursues a high-carbohydrate diet, having read that this may preempt symptoms in porphyria, and gains 90 lb. She is unable to work. She is referred to a porphyria specialist, who obtains genetic testing. The results are negative for any form of acute porphyria. \nThe history illustrates that misdiagnosis of HCP can have life-altering consequences. ",

Here's a breakdown of what I observe, focusing on potential abnormalities and relevant observations:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe ECG shows a sinus rhythm, but with some concerning features that warrant further investigation.  The rate appears to be within the normal range (approximately 60-100 bpm based on the R-R intervals), but there are several changes that suggest underlying cardiac pathology. \n\n**Detailed Observations:**\n\n1. **Rate:** The heart rate appears to be approximately 70-75 bpm.  The R-R intervals are relatively consistent, suggesting a regular rhythm.\n\n2. **P Waves:** The P waves are present and appear generally normal in morphology. They are upright in leads I, II, aVF, and V1-V6, which is consistent with a normal sinus rhythm. However, their amplitude is slightly reduced in some leads, which could indicate underlying conduction abnormalities.\n\n3. **PR Interval:** The PR intervals are normal in duration (approximately 0.16-0.20 seconds).\n\n4. **QRS Complex:** This is where we see the most significant abnormalities.\n   * **Width:** The QRS complexes are widened, particularly in leads V1, V2, V5, and V6. This widening suggests a delay in ventricular depolarization, which could be due to several factors.\n   * **Morphology:**  The QRS complexes appear notched and slurred in V1 and V2, suggestive of left anterior fascicular block (LAFB) or left bundle branch block (LBBB). The Q waves are present and prominent in some leads, which could be indicative of prior myocardial infarction. \n   * **Amplitude:** The QRS amplitude is somewhat reduced in some leads, particularly V1-V3. \n\n5. **ST Segment & T Waves:**\n   * **ST Segment:** The ST segments are depressed in leads V4-V6, and slightly depressed in leads I and aVL. This depression is concerning and could indicate myocardial ischemia or infarction.\n   * **T Waves:** The T waves are inverted in leads V1-V3, and inverted in leads I and aVL. This is consistent with the ST segment depression and further supports the possibility of myocardial ischemia.\n\n6. **Axis:** The overall QRS axis appears to be left-axis deviation, which is consistent with LAFB or LBBB. \n\n7."
