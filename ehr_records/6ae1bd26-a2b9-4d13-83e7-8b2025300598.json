  "reasoning": "The patient, John Doe, presents with chest pain, a symptom that can be associated with several rare genetic diseases, particularly those affecting connective tissue or the cardiovascular system.  The lack of documented physical exam, assessment, and plan makes it impossible to rule out conditions like Marfan syndrome based on the provided information.  While the chief complaint is chest pain, the literature provided details several conditions with overlapping symptoms.  Marfan syndrome, for example, can manifest with pectus deformities (chest wall abnormalities) which can cause chest pain.  The literature also describes hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which frequently presents with chest pain and can be genetically linked.  Given the absence of a complete medical history and examination, it is impossible to definitively rule out these or other genetic conditions.  Therefore, genetic testing is recommended to investigate potential underlying genetic causes for the chest pain.",

However, increasing curves can cause deformity or back ache in some people. Kyphosis does not usually lead to a decrease in pulmonary function. Kyphosis in people with Marfan syndrome may occur in the upper (thoracic) spine or in the lower (lumbar) spine. \nThe treatment for kyphosis is similar to the treatment for scoliosis. In a growing child, a brace is often effective. In an older patient or in someone with more severe kyphosis, the brace does not help. Exercises may help prevent pain, but if not, surgery is an option. It is done in almost the same way as scoliosis surgery, although it is less commonly needed. People with kyphosis should be careful to get enough calcium and take up a mild exercise program to prevent osteoporosis, which may make the condition worse. \niii. Pectus Deformities \nThe two most common chest abnormalities related to Marfan syndrome involve the breastbone (sternum). Pectus excavatum is a sunken (or excavated) sternum. It develops to varying degrees in many people with Marfan syndrome, as well as in children who are not affected. It may impair the breathing in more severe cases, especially when there are other abnormalities in the spine, heart or lungs. For some people, it may become a cosmetic concern. \n\nThere is no brace available to correct pectus excavatum; the only treatment option is surgery. There are often good medical reasons, in addition to cosmetic reasons, to repair a severe pectus excavatum. If needed, surgery should be performed in mid to late adolescence by a thoracic surgeon. \nSurgery consists of raising the deformed sternum and ribs, straightening them and holding them with a metal bar. It requires several days of hospitalization. The success rate is high. The metal bar is removed after four to six months in a brief outpatient procedure. Afterward, the sternum will look much improved, although there is usually slight residual abnormal chest shape that cannot be fixed completely without taking undue risks. In a few cases, the deformity may recur if it is corrected early in life. \n",

Consistent with his clinical history, physical features, and family history, DNA testing identified an Arg403Gln mutation in MYH7. \nBACKGROUND \nDisease Etiology and Incidence \nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM, MIM 192600), the most common monogenic cardiovascular disease, is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in approximately 20 genes encoding proteins of the cardiac sarcomere. Of those patients with positive genetic tests, approximately $70\\%$ are found to have mutations in the two most common genes, MYH7 and MYBPC3, whereas other genes, including those encoding troponin T, troponin I, Tropomyosin 1, and alpha-actin each account for a small proportion of patients ( $1\\%$ to $5\\,\\%$ ). \nPathogenesis \nOver 1500 mutations have been reported in genes encoding thick and thin myofilament proteins of the sarcomere or contiguous $Z$ disk. Mutations in several additional sarcomere (or calcium-handling) genes have been proposed, but with less evidence supporting pathogenicity. \nApproximately $60\\%$ of adult and pediatric patients with a family history of HCM will have a sarcomere mutation identified. In contrast, only approximately $30\\%$ of patients without a family history will have positive results, often due to sporadic or de novo mutations ( $65\\%$ of the probands) that may, however be passed on to the next generation. Approximately \n$3\\,\\%$ to $4\\%$ of males with HCM will have unrecognized Fabry disease, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the $\\upalpha$ galactosidase A gene. \nPhenotype and Natural History \nHCM is characterized by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) (Fig.",

His serum creatine kinase level was 50-fold higher than normal. Because the history, physical examination findings, and elevated creatine kinase level strongly suggested a myopathy, A.Y. was referred to the neurogenetics clinic for further evaluation. Results of his muscle biopsy showed marked variation of muscle fiber size, fiber necrosis, fat and connective tissue proliferation, and no staining for dystrophin. On the basis of these results, A.Y. was given a provisional diagnosis of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and he was tested for deletions of the dystrophin gene; he was found to have a deletion of exons 45 through 48. Subsequent testing showed his mother to be a carrier. The family was therefore counseled that the risk for affected sons was $50\\%$ , the risk for affected daughters was low but dependent on skewing of $\\mathsf{X}$ inactivation, and the risk for carrier daughters was $50\\%$ .

It has an incidence of approximately 1 in 3500 male births. \nPathogenesis \nDMD encodes dystrophin, an intracellular protein that is expressed predominantly in smooth, skeletal, and cardiac muscle as well as in some brain neurons (see Chapter 12). In skeletal muscle, dystrophin is part of a large complex of sarcolemma-associated proteins that confers stability to the sarcolemma (see Fig. 12-20). \n\n",

When the frequency of expression of a phenotype is less than $100\\%$ \u2014that is, when some of those who have the relevant genotype completely fail to express it\u2014the disorder is said to show reduced or incomplete penetrance. Penetrance is all or nothing. It is the percentage of people at any given age with a predisposing genotype who are affected, regardless of the severity. \nPenetrance of some disorders is age dependent; that is, it may occur any time, from early in intrauterine development all the way to the postreproductive years. \nSome disorders are lethal prenatally, whereas others can be recognized prenatally (e.g., by ultrasonography; see Chapter 17) but are consistent with a liveborn infant; still others may be recognized only at birth (congenital).\\* Other disorders have their onset typically or exclusively in childhood or in adulthood. Even in these, however, and sometimes even in the same family, two individuals carrying the same diseasecausing genotype may develop the disease at very different ages. \nIn contrast to penetrance, expressivity refers not to the presence or absence of a phenotype, but to the severity of expression of that phenotype among individuals with the same disease-causing genotype. When the severity of disease differs in people who have the same genotype, the phenotype is said to show variable expressivity. Even in the same family, two individuals carrying the same mutant genes may have some signs and symptoms in common, whereas their other disease manifestations may be quite different, depending on which tissues or organs happen to be affected. The challenge to the clinician caring for these families is to not miss very subtle signs of a disorder in a family member and, as a result, either mistake mild expressivity for lack of penetrance or infer that the individual does not have the disease-causing genotype. \nPEDIGREES \nSingle-gene disorders are characterized by their patterns of transmission in families. To establish the pattern of transmission, a usual first step is to obtain information about the family history of the patient and to summarize the details in the form of a pedigree, a graphical representation of the family tree, with use of standard symbols (Fig. 7-2).",

Her physicians agree that the clinical picture and lab findings are consistent with acute porphyria, specifically HCP.

There was no history of fever, infection, or trauma, and her medical history was otherwise unremarkable; findings from the previous visit were normal except for a low hemoglobin level and a mildly enlarged spleen. Findings from the physical examination were normal except for a palpable spleen tip and swollen feet. Her feet were tender to palpation, and she would not stand up. Both parents had siblings who died in childhood of infection and others who may have had sickle cell disease. In view of this history and the recurrent painful swelling of her feet, her physician tested C.W. for sickle cell disease by hemoglobin electrophoresis. This test result documented sickle cell hemoglobin, Hb S, in C.W. \nBACKGROUND \nDisease Etiology and Incidence \nSickle cell disease (MIM 603903) is an autosomal recessive disorder of hemoglobin in which the $\\upbeta$ subunit genes have a missense mutation that substitutes valine for glutamic acid at amino acid 6. The disease is most commonly due to homozygosity for the sickle cell mutation, although compound heterozygosity for the sickle allele and a hemoglobin C or a $\\upbeta$ -thalassemia allele can also cause sickle cell disease (see Chapter 11). The prevalence of sickle cell disease varies widely among populations in proportion to past and present exposure to malaria (see Table). The sickle cell mutation appears to confer some resistance to malaria and thus a survival advantage to individuals heterozygous for the mutation. \nPathogenesis \nHemoglobin is composed of four subunits, two $\\upalpha$ subunits encoded by HBA on chromosome 16 and two $\\upbeta$ subunits encoded by the HBB gene on chromosome 11 (see Chapter 11).",

In these situations, the risk for recurrence in first-degree relatives of affected individuals may be increased over the background incidence of the disease in the population.

However, the distinctive clinical features associated with these other lysosomal storage diseases, the availability of biochemical testing in clinical laboratories, and an understanding of their natural history should help in distinguishing between them. \nManagement \nEvaluations Following Initial Diagnosis \nTo establish the extent of disease and needs in an individual diagnosed with alpha-mannosidosis, the evaluations summarized in this section (if not performed as part of the evaluation that led to the diagnosis) are recommended: \n\u2022 Medical history including evidence of hearing loss, irritability, depression; change in social, domestic, school- or work-related activities or in ability to walk distances; diarrhea or incontinence, muscle pain, joint aches, reduced range of movement, and bone pain   \n\u2022 Physical examination including otoscopy, ophthalmoscopy, assessment of liver and spleen size, auscultation of heart and lungs, neurologic status including gait, and orthopedic evaluation including joint range of motion. In children, attention to growth (plot height, weight, and especially head circumference using standardized growth charts)   \n\u2022 Examination by an otolaryngologist to detect impaired hearing and middle-ear infections   \n\u2022 Audiometry.

Contractures of the hips, knees, ankles, elbows, and fngers occur in approximately $25\\%$ and may be present at birth or occur in older persons with decreased mobility secondary to severe weakness. Spinal deformities including scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis, and lordosis are seen in $25\\%$ or more of individuals. \nDiagnosis/testing \nDiagnosis is based on a combination of clinical presentation and morphologic features observed on skeletal muscle histology.

Their common clinical features include: scoliosis, pes planus, chest wall deformities, pneumothorax, dural ectasia and aortic root dilation.20 Figure 2 displays a CT scan of a characteristic pear-shaped aortic root aneurysm in a patient with MFS.

Te presence or absence of blue sclerae is unreliable in distinguishing COL1A1/2-OI from child abuse because blue sclerae are ofen found in unafecte d normal infants until about age 18 months; children with OI type IV may not have blue sclerae. \nFamily history is ofen unrevealing; families suspected of possible child abuse ofen provide an unverifed family history of frequent fractures; conversely, the family history of individuals with COL1A1/2-OI ofen does not reveal any other afected individuals because of a de novo pathogenic variant in the proband or the presence of a mild phenotype in relatives. \nLaboratory testing (typically molecular genetic testing of COL1A1 and COL1A2) usually is not needed to diferentiate COL1A1/2-OI from NAT, and in some cases, the time required to perform such testing can delay proper disposition of child abuse cases [Steiner et al 1996]. Marlowe and colleagues suggest: \"Given the inability to identify all children with OI by clinical examination in situations of suspected non-accidental injury, laboratory testing for OI (and other genetic predispositions for fractures) is a valuable adjunct in discerning the basis for fractures and may identify a small group of children with previously undiagnosed OI\" [Marlowe et al 2002].

Results of her complete blood count unexpectedly showed an elevated white blood cell count of $31\\times10^{9}/\\mathrm{L}$ and a platelet count of $650\\times$ ${}^{70^{9}/1}$ . The peripheral smear revealed basophilia and immature granulocytes. Her physician referred her to the oncology department for further evaluation. Her bone marrow was found to be hypercellular with an increased number of myeloid and megakaryocytic cells and an increased ratio of myeloid to erythroid cells. Cytogenetic analysis of her marrow identified several myeloid cells with a Philadelphia chromosome, der(22) t(9;22)(q34;q11.2). Her oncologist explained that she had chronic myelogenous leukemia, which, although indolent now, had a substantial risk for becoming a life-threatening leukemia in the next few years. She was also advised that although the only potentially curative therapy currently available is allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, newly developed drug therapy targeting the function of the oncogene in chronic myelogenous leukemia is able to induce or to maintain long-lasting remissions. \nBACKGROUND \nDisease Etiology and Incidence \nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML, MIM 608232) is a clonal expansion of transformed hematopoietic progenitor cells that increases circulating myeloid cells. Transformation of progenitor cells occurs by expression of the BCR-ABL1 oncogene. CML accounts for $15\\bar{\\%}$ of adult leukemia and has an incidence of 1 to 2 per 100,000; the age-adjusted incidence is higher in men than in women (1.3 to 1.7 versus 1.0; see Chapter 15). \nPathogenesis \nApproximately $95\\%$ of patients with CML have a Philadelphia chromosome; the remainder have complex or variant translocations (see Chapter 15).",

Te families reported do not have neuralgic amyotrophy. \u2022 A subset of individuals with Michelin tire baby syndrome (with what now may be known as \"circumferential skin creases, Kunze type\") also may share the following with HNA: craniofacial features (including relatively closely spaced eyes and short palpebral fssures), clef palate, and circumferential skin folds [Wouters et al 2011]. \nManagement \nEvaluations Following Initial Diagnosis \nTo establish the extent of disease in an individual diagnosed with hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy, the following evaluations are recommended: \n\u2022 Comprehensive neuromuscular evaluation   \n\u2022 Needle EMG to identify the severity and extent of denervation and reinnervation   \n\u2022 Evaluation of phrenic nerve involvement by chest x-ray, ultrasound/fuoroscopic evaluation of diaphragm movement, and pulmonary function tests in seated and supine positions   \n\u2022 Clinical genetics consultation \nFor a practical overview of the physical examination and the value of additional investigations in neuralgic amyotrophy see pn.bmj.com. \nTreatment of Manifestations \ntly, no efective therapy is proven to abort or shorten an HN \nTreatment of acute episodes of pain and weakness with corticosteroids has been proposed based on retrospective analysis of cases [van Alfen et al 2009, van Eijk et al 2009]. Tese reports summarize retrospective, anecdotal evidence that corticosteroids can have a favorable efect on pain and recovery.",
