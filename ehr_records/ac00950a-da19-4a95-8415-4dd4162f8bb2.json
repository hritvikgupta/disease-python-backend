  "reasoning": "Based on the provided patient data, there is no clinical indication for genetic testing for a rare genetic disease.  The chief complaint is solely a headache, with no other symptoms or physical exam findings documented. The vital signs are within normal limits. The absence of a documented assessment and plan further limits the ability to determine if any underlying condition, including a rare genetic disorder, is present. The provided medical literature describes various orthostatic intolerance conditions and their diagnostic criteria, but none of these are suggested by Christy Davis's limited presentation.  Headache alone is not a sufficient indicator for genetic testing for conditions like Marfan syndrome, which typically presents with a constellation of musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and ocular features.

Test factors can include the degree of patient movement permitted, whether there is invasive instrumentation (higher rates of syncope can be seen if arterial catheters are placed), the use of pharmacologic agents to provoke hypotension (e.g., isoproterenol [Natale et al., 1995], nitroglycerine), and the way an abnormal test is defined. Past studies often required reproduction of syncope as the end-point of testing. However, OH, POTS, and NMH can be identified before syncope occurs, and the table can be returned to the horizontal position. \nIn most laboratories, heart rate and blood pressure are monitored using beat-to-beat measurements, although in some centers only intermittent blood pressure measurements are made, for example, every 1\u20132 minutes for $5{-}10$ minutes, then every 5 minutes unless presyncopal symptoms are identified. Measurement of end-tidal $\\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ for detecting orthostatic hypocapnia is a helpful adjunctive technique (Naschitz et al., 2000; Natelson et al., 2007; Novak, 2018; Razumovsky et al., 2003; van Campen et al., 2020a). During both supine and upright phases, at approximately 5-minute intervals, patients are asked to rate changes in symptoms on a 0\u201310 scale (lightheadedness, fatigue, headache, mental fogginess, warmth, shortness of breath, nausea, and pain). \nHead-up tilt testing is not necessary in all individuals with orthostatic symptoms. Among those in whom the clinical history is consistent with reflex or neurally mediated syncope, and the heart is structurally normal, head-up tilt testing is no longer thought to be necessary for diagnosis (Benditt et al., 1996; Moya et al., 2009; Sheldon, 2005; Strickberger et al., \n2006).",

      "contents": " Approximately 40 percent of healthy adolescents would be misclassified as having POTS using the adult heart rate increment of 30 bpm (Singer et al., 2012). At all ages, the diagnosis of POTS is based on more than just the heart rate and also requires the individual to have chronic orthostatic symptoms. Heart rate elevation alone is insufficient for a diagnosis of POTS in individuals who are dehydrated or are being treated with vasodilating medications. Conversely, at the time of orthostatic testing, concurrent consumption of substances that increase plasma volume, such as salt tablets, or agents used to treat orthostatic intolerance (e.g., serotonin reuptake inhibitors, oral contraceptives, stimulant medications, beta adrenergic antagonists, or other medications) can obscure the diagnosis of POTS. \nInappropriate Sinus Tachycardia \nAs the name suggests, this condition is diagnosed when the patient is in sinus rhythm, but has a heart rate higher than 100 bpm at rest. Symptoms of inappropriate sinus tachycardia are similar to those in POTS (Sheldon et al., 2015). \nNeurally Mediated Hypotension \nNMH is a reflex form of hypotension, and while its physiology is synonymous with vasovagal syncope or neurocardiogenic syncope (BouHolaigah et al., 1995; Grubb, 2005; Rowe et al., 1995), NMH is a more accurate description of the phenotype. Many with NMH experience the same characteristically abrupt drop in blood pressure during tilt testing as those with vasovagal syncope, and they can experience chronic daily orthostatic symptoms without having completely lost consciousness. In both children and adults, NMH occurs after the 3-minute cutoff for orthostatic hypotension and is characterized by at least a $25~\\mathrm{mm\\;Hg}$ reduction in systolic blood pressure. At the time of presyncope or hypotension, affected individuals can develop a relative slowing of the heart rate that can progress to junctional bradycardia or even asystole.",

When orthostatic testing lasts less than 10 minutes, this form of hypotension can be missed (Bou-Holaigah et al., 1995). NMH is more common in females than in males and in younger adults and adolescents than in older people; often, the family history is positive (Grubb, 2005). \nAs has been reviewed elsewhere (Grubb, 2005; Jhanjee et al., 2009; van Dijk et al., 2021; van Lieshout et al., 1991; Wieling et al., 2004), the \nCopyright National Academy of Sciences.

These responses lead to slowing of the heart rate and vasodilation, which can result ultimately in a profound drop in blood pressure or syncope if the individual remains upright. Markedly elevated epinephrine levels are present prior to syncope (Benditt et al., 2003; Jardine et al., 1997). Precipitating factors for NHM can include prolonged standing; warm environments (such as hot weather, hot showers, or hot tubs); pain; venipuncture; the sight of blood; or sudden stretching of mechanoreceptors in the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and lungs. These phenomena can occur individually or in combination (Grubb, 2005; Jhanjee et al., 2009; van Lieshout et al., 1991; Wieling et al., 2004). Although many patients with NMH experience only isolated episodes of syncope that are separated by long periods of normal function, NMH physiology can be associated with chronic, daily orthostatic symptoms. Patients referred for evaluation of recurrent syncope report chronic fatigue, as well as impaired quality of life (Kenney and Graham, 2001; Legge et al., 2008; Rose et al., 2000).",

In the most impaired individuals, brief orthostatic vital signs obtained in supine, seated, and standing positions over 1\u20133 minutes in some instances, or a 20-degree tilt angle, are sufficient as an indication of orthostatic intolerance. In those who have symptoms provoked during the tilt testing, and who might be at risk for postexertional malaise in the following days, our experience is that this symptom flare can be ameliorated by administration of $1{-}2\\,\\mathrm{~L~}$ of warmed normal saline immediately after the end of the period upright (IOM, 2015). \nStanding Tests \nTwo closely related forms of standing tests are used in the orthostatic intolerance literature: active standing (Plash et al., 2013; Streeten et al., 2000) and passive standing, in which the individual leans against a wall (Hyatt et al., 1975; Roma et al., 2018a). Standing tests can be conducted in a clinical office, and thus are cheaper and more readily available than tilt table tests. No specialist consultation or specialized equipment is required.

Although the duration of upright posture can be as long as 60 minutes (Streeten et al., 2000), most centers perform a 10-minute standing test to identify POTS and to ascertain worsening symptoms during orthostasis. As with 10-minute tilt testing, this duration of standing will miss many instances of dOH and NMH. Symptoms are recorded immediately before standing and at intervals of 1\u20132 minutes when upright. Some studies during the COVID-19 pandemic have been conducted at home, but it is important that the test be witnessed given the potential for injury to occur if individuals have a rapid onset of syncope.

In response to 30 minutes of head-up tilt table testing, 247 (58 percent) of the ME/CFS participants had a normal heart rate and blood pressure response, as did all of the healthy controls, while 62 (14 percent) with ME/CFS developed dOH and 120 (28 percent) met criteria for POTS (van Campen et al., 2020a).

When IMH is present, the extent and thickness of the hematoma can be documented and, when PAUs are present, the presence of and size of pseudoaneurysms can be easily defined. \n\n2. In general, the choice of the initial imaging modality should be based on the patient\u2019s history and clinical presentation, the specific clinical questions to be answered, and the institutional availability, experience, and expertise with each of the diagnostic imaging techniques.6 In certain clinical circumstances, for example, patients with a history of an iodinated contrast reaction or patients who are too unstable to travel to the radiology suite, CT may not be preferred. Echocardiography (TEE/ TTE) is an alternative. TTE is noninvasive, can be performed at the bedside, and may be helpful in eliciting the diagnosis of AAS and quickly identifying complications of AAS, such as AR or pericardial effusion and tamponade. TEE is preferred to TTE, however, because of its higher sensitivity and better anatomic resolution; TEE can be performed at the bedside in the emergency department or, alternatively, once the patient is in the operating room. MRI is most commonly the third-choice modality, given that it is not readily available, requires skilled interpretation, and has longer acquisition times, as well as the fact it is challenging to provide clinical care to potentially unstable patients while in an MRI scanner. Consequently, MRI is most often used as a follow-up imaging modality in patients in which there is diagnostic uncertainty. Nevertheless, MRI may be the study of choice in the acute setting for a stable patient with a contraindication to iodinated contrast. \n\n7.3. Medical Management of AAS \nSynopsis \nPatients presenting with AAS need to be treated promptly to prevent acute and chronic complications. In all patients with AAS, immediate medical therapy is indicated while considering urgent surgical (in patients with type A aortic dissection), endovascular intervention (in patients with type B aortic dissection), or both; medical therapy includes aggressive heart rate and BP management as well as pain control.",

Hot environments are detrimental to those with orthostatic intolerance, as heat will shift blood from the central circulation to the skin. Patients with heat intolerance usually need to be in an air-conditioned environment. \nBecause PEM and postinfectious exacerbations in symptoms can be unpredictable, those with orthostatic intolerance need flexible hours and attendance. Because increased physical activity can provoke further PEM, lifting objects too frequently might aggravate fatigue and PEM, especially as the weight of the items increases. These individuals often need elevator access, and some benefit from a place to lie down at work. \nCONCLUDING COMMENTS \nOrthostatic intolerance is common in individuals with EDS and hypermobility spectrum disorders and can be associated with heterogeneous blood pressure and heart rate responses to orthostatic stress, including POTS, orthostatic hypotension, and NMH. Importantly, as measured by Doppler techniques, orthostatic reductions in cerebral blood flow can be present even in those with a normal heart rate and blood pressure response to upright posture. Prominent orthostatic intolerance symptoms include lightheadedness or syncope, fatigue, exercise intolerance, cognitive dysfunction, and headaches. Management of orthostatic intolerance requires close attention to the factors that provoke symptoms, a willingness to try several medications before achieving a good fit, and a realization that medications often can help manage symptoms but do not necessarily cure orthostatic intolerance. The response to therapy remains less predictable than is desired. Complicating the management of orthostatic intolerance in EDS is the presence of multiple comorbidities. Measuring the ability to work in those with orthostatic intolerance is challenging, given the potential for prolonged upright posture to be followed by unpredictable postexertional increases in symptoms for days afterwards. Orthostatic intolerance can be a substantial contributor to disability, and those with orthostatic intolerance can have comorbid ME/CFS that further limits function.",

As a result, we will draw on observations from the ME/CFS literature to inform the discussion of treatment and accommodations in the heritable disorders of connective tissue. \nORTHOSTATIC INTOLERANCE: SYMPTOMS, PHYSIOLOGY, DIAGNOSIS \nOrthostatic intolerance refers to a heterogeneous group of circulatory disorders in which individuals develop symptoms upon assuming and maintaining upright posture, improving (although not necessarily resolving completely) after they return to a recumbent posture (Gerrity et al., 2002\u20132003; Low et al., 2009). Hemodynamic abnormalities in orthostatic intolerance can include classical or delayed orthostatic hypotension, neurally mediated hypotension (NMH), and postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS) (Freeman et al., 2011; Goldstein et al., 2002; Low et al., 2009; Rosen and Cryer, 1982; Schondorf and Low, 1993; Sheldon et al., 2015; Stewart et al., 2018). More recently it has become evident that a relatively large proportion of individuals with orthostatic intolerance lack these abnormal heart rate and blood pressure responses to upright posture, but have substantial reductions in brain blood flow when upright (van Campen et al., 2020a). \nThe most common symptoms of chronic orthostatic intolerance are shown in Table B-1. These clinical features are largely due to two principal physiological changes in response to orthostatic stress: (1) reduced cerebral blood flow and (2) the compensatory adrenergic response to reduced cerebral blood flow (Low et al., 2009). Many of the symptoms in Table B-1 overlap with features seen in EDS, including fatigue, cognitive problems, headaches, exercise intolerance, and anxiety. Patients with orthostatic intolerance can experience lengthy delays before diagnosis, and thus a similarly lengthy delay in initiating therapy. For example, one large survey of POTS patients identified a median diagnostic delay of 24 months (Shaw et al., 2019).",

Begin annual mammography in women at age 30 years with consideration of annual breast MRI in women between ages 30 and 50 years. Individuals with NF1 whole-gene deletions, large or growing plexiform neurofbromas or intracranial tumors, symptomatic vascular disease, progressive osseous lesions, or other serious disease manifestations require more frequent targeted follow up. \nGenetic counseling \nNF1 is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately half of afected individuals have NF1 as the result of a de novo NF1 disease-causing variant. Each child of an individual with NF1 has a $50\\%$ chance of inheriting the disease-causing variant. Penetrance is close to $100\\%$ ; thus, a child who inherits an NF1-causing variant is expected to develop features of NF1, but the features may be considerably more (or less) severe in an afected child than in his or her afected parent. Prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible if the disease-causing variant in a family is known. \nDiagnosis \nSuggestive Findings \nNeurofbromatosis 1 (NF1) should be suspected in individuals who have any one of the following clinical features: \n\u2022 Six or more caf\u00e9 au lait macules (CALMs; Figure 1) $>\\!5\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ in greatest diameter in prepubertal individuals and ${>}15\\;\\mathrm{mm}$ in greatest diameter in postpubertal individuals   \n\u2022 Freckling in the axillary or inguinal regions   \n\u2022 Two or more neurofbromas (Figure 2) of any type or one plexiform neurofbroma (Figure 3)   \n\u2022 Optic pathway glioma   \n",

      "contents": " The acetabulum is the socket of the hip joint. The cause of this condition is not known. It does not cause problems or symptoms in childhood, but in adulthood, the deepened sockets can lead to earlier arthritic change, which is noted with aching in the hips or groin. Some people with this diagnosis need to have artificial hips in middle age or later. This affects less than $5\\%$ of people with Marfan syndrome. \nB. Heart and Blood Vessels (Cardiovascular System) \nProblems with the heart and blood vessels are common in people with Marfan syndrome, and potentially life-threatening. People with Marfan syndrome should be tested regularly for cardiovascular problems and treatments range from medication to surgery. \ni. Tests to Monitor Cardiovascular Condition \nPeople with Marfan syndrome must have regular tests to monitor their cardiovascular condition. These help find problems before there is an emergency. Tests may be performed annually or more often, in some cases every three months. Following are some tests doctors often use. \nEchocardiogram   \nShows all the heart structures including blood valves and the part of the aorta closest to the heart.   \nMRI or CT scans   \nShows all segments of the aorta.   \nTEE   \nA special type of echocardiography that shows the ascending and descending thoracic aorta in addition to the heart valves. \nAn echocardiogram is a painless test during which high-frequency sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced through the chest wall and off the heart to produce a sonar picture of how the valves move. \nii. Medications \nMedications can help treat many types of cardiovascular problems. Medications include: \nBeta-blockers   \nBeta-blockers help lower blood pressure and reduce the force of heartbeats. They may help prevent or slow down aortic dilation (enlarged aorta) and can reduce the risk of aortic dissection (tears between layers of the aorta). For many people with Marfan syndrome, beta-blockers are a first choice medication.   \nAngiotensin receptor blockers (ARB\u2019s)   \nRecent research has shown that one ARB drug, Losartan, may prevent aortic growth. A clinical trial is now underway to compare this medication to beta-blockers in people who have Marfan syndrome.   \nAngiotensin Converting Enzyme inhibitors (ACE-i)   \n",

      "contents": " Among patients evaluated for chronic orthostatic intolerance, approximately 25 percent have neurocardiogenic syncope without POTS (Goldstein et al., 2005). Thus, POTS cannot be regarded as the only form of chronic orthostatic intolerance. \nLow Orthostatic Tolerance \nThis condition is characterized by the presence of frequent orthostatic symptoms without the heart rate and blood pressure changes that characterize OH, NMH, or POTS (IOM, 2015). Recent research has shown that many of these patients have reductions in cerebral blood flow as measured either by transcranial Doppler ultrasound (which measures cerebral blood flow velocity) or by Doppler ultrasound of the internal carotids and vertebral arteries, which measures total blood flow to the brain (Novak, 2018; van Campen et al., 2020a). \nTesting for Orthostatic Intolerance \nThere is no gold standard test for orthostatic intolerance, but head-up tilt table tests and standing tests are the primary types of testing used in clinical practice. The methods for conducting each type of test vary. We do not know all the pathophysiological contributors to such symptoms as lightheadedness, and some classical \u201corthostatic\u201d symptoms can be reproduced by postural maneuvers, such as passive straight leg raising, that do not involve upright posture (Rowe et al., 2016). \nCopyright National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved. \nHead-Up Tilt Table Testing \nModern head-up tilt table testing is conducted using a motorized table with a footboard for weight-bearing (Benditt et al., 1996). The test begins with the patient lying supine and loosely restrained by belts that prevent injury if loss of consciousness ensues. In our center, the period of supine rest lasts 15 minutes, but some investigators have positioned patients supine for up to 60 minutes. Next, the tilt table is gradually raised to a 60\u201370 degree angle. Higher tilt table angles during testing can provoke syncope more readily in healthy controls. Depending on which form of orthostatic intolerance is being evaluated, the duration of upright tilt can vary between institutions. Ten minutes of upright posture is sufficient to detect OH and POTS, but upright tilt for 45\u201360 minutes is often required for detection of dOH and NMH. \n",
