  "reasoning": "The patient, John Doe, presents with chest pain.  While the provided medical history is minimal, chest pain is a significant symptom that warrants investigation, especially given the context of the provided medical literature. The literature extensively discusses chest pain in the context of several genetic disorders, most notably Marfan syndrome.  Marfan syndrome is characterized by a range of symptoms affecting the cardiovascular, skeletal, and ocular systems.  Chest pain in Marfan syndrome can be associated with aortic dissection, a life-threatening condition.  Pneumothorax, another condition discussed, also presents with chest pain and is more common in individuals with Marfan syndrome.  The lack of a documented physical exam, assessment, and plan makes it impossible to rule out these conditions based on clinical findings alone.  Therefore, genetic testing, potentially focusing on the FBN1 gene (associated with Marfan syndrome), is recommended to explore the possibility of an underlying genetic disorder causing the chest pain.  Other genetic conditions mentioned in the literature (e.g., Mucolipidosis III, Emery-Dreifuss Muscular Dystrophy) are less likely given the limited information, but a broader genetic panel might be considered if the FBN1 test is negative.",

      "contents": " Hunched Back (Kyphosis) \nThis is a curve best seen from the side. It is normal for people to have a slight kyphosis in the upper spine. However, increasing curves can cause deformity or back ache in some people. Kyphosis does not usually lead to a decrease in pulmonary function. Kyphosis in people with Marfan syndrome may occur in the upper (thoracic) spine or in the lower (lumbar) spine. \nThe treatment for kyphosis is similar to the treatment for scoliosis. In a growing child, a brace is often effective. In an older patient or in someone with more severe kyphosis, the brace does not help. Exercises may help prevent pain, but if not, surgery is an option. It is done in almost the same way as scoliosis surgery, although it is less commonly needed. People with kyphosis should be careful to get enough calcium and take up a mild exercise program to prevent osteoporosis, which may make the condition worse. \niii. Pectus Deformities \nThe two most common chest abnormalities related to Marfan syndrome involve the breastbone (sternum). Pectus excavatum is a sunken (or excavated) sternum. It develops to varying degrees in many people with Marfan syndrome, as well as in children who are not affected. It may impair the breathing in more severe cases, especially when there are other abnormalities in the spine, heart or lungs. For some people, it may become a cosmetic concern. \n\nThere is no brace available to correct pectus excavatum; the only treatment option is surgery. There are often good medical reasons, in addition to cosmetic reasons, to repair a severe pectus excavatum. If needed, surgery should be performed in mid to late adolescence by a thoracic surgeon. \nSurgery consists of raising the deformed sternum and ribs, straightening them and holding them with a metal bar. It requires several days of hospitalization. The success rate is high. The metal bar is removed after four to six months in a brief outpatient procedure. Afterward, the sternum will look much improved, although there is usually slight residual abnormal chest shape that cannot be fixed completely without taking undue risks. In a few cases, the deformity may recur if it is corrected early in life. \n",

      "contents": " Use of electrocardiographic-synchronized CT techniques should be considered when there is a need to accurately depict mediastinal structures (eg, proximal aorta, coronary ostia). When IMH is present, the extent and thickness of the hematoma can be documented and, when PAUs are present, the presence of and size of pseudoaneurysms can be easily defined. \n\n2. In general, the choice of the initial imaging modality should be based on the patient\u2019s history and clinical presentation, the specific clinical questions to be answered, and the institutional availability, experience, and expertise with each of the diagnostic imaging techniques.6 In certain clinical circumstances, for example, patients with a history of an iodinated contrast reaction or patients who are too unstable to travel to the radiology suite, CT may not be preferred. Echocardiography (TEE/ TTE) is an alternative. TTE is noninvasive, can be performed at the bedside, and may be helpful in eliciting the diagnosis of AAS and quickly identifying complications of AAS, such as AR or pericardial effusion and tamponade. TEE is preferred to TTE, however, because of its higher sensitivity and better anatomic resolution; TEE can be performed at the bedside in the emergency department or, alternatively, once the patient is in the operating room. MRI is most commonly the third-choice modality, given that it is not readily available, requires skilled interpretation, and has longer acquisition times, as well as the fact it is challenging to provide clinical care to potentially unstable patients while in an MRI scanner. Consequently, MRI is most often used as a follow-up imaging modality in patients in which there is diagnostic uncertainty. Nevertheless, MRI may be the study of choice in the acute setting for a stable patient with a contraindication to iodinated contrast. \n\n7.3. Medical Management of AAS \nSynopsis \nPatients presenting with AAS need to be treated promptly to prevent acute and chronic complications. In all patients with AAS, immediate medical therapy is indicated while considering urgent surgical (in patients with type A aortic dissection), endovascular intervention (in patients with type B aortic dissection), or both; medical therapy includes aggressive heart rate and BP management as well as pain control.",

This is usually a CT scan of the chest with IV contrast or a transesophageal echocardiogram. An MRI is occasionally used as a first test. If the patient has an allergy to IV dye, shellfish or Iodine, this should be mentioned to the emergency department personnel. It is important to remember that a chest x-ray may not show an aortic dissection and, if dissection is suspected, a normal chest x-ray should not deter further evaluation. \n",

Pectus Deformities \nDepression of the breast bone (pectus excavatum) can reduce the space available for the lungs somewhat. This is usually not a problem unless the person also has severe scoliosis and lordosis of the upper spine. A pectus excavatum also interferes with the mechanics of expanding the lungs. The primary symptom is shortness of breath during exercise. A protrusion of the breast bone (pectus carinatum) has little effect on lung volumes or function. \nii. Pneumothorax \nOne possible effect of a mutation in fibrillin-1 is pneumothorax, in which air escapes the lung into the space between the lung and the inner lining of the chest. The symptoms of this are shortness of breath, a dry cough, and often sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain (pain that gets worse when you take a deep breath). The pain may be confused with an aortic dissection or heart attack, and should always prompt evaluation in an emergency room. A pneumothorax is most common in people who have a \u2018bleb\u2019 or bubble of lung tissue, typically at the top of the lungs. \n\niii. Emphysema \nEmphysema is a condition in which the walls of the tiny air sacs in the lungs are damaged so they cannot push all the used air out of the lungs. Approximately $10{-}15\\%$ of people with Marfan syndrome have emphysema, but it may be underdiagnosed. Symptoms include shortness of breath during activity, frequent bronchitis (often as a result of common colds or viruses settling in the chest) and low blood oxygen. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a chest x-ray, CT scan, pulmonary function test or arterial blood test. \niv. Asthma \nAsthma, which is very common in the general population, is also present in the Marfan community. People with Marfan syndrome who have asthma should see a respiratory specialist who can coordinate care with other specialists because the conventional treatments for asthma\u2014beta-agonists\u2014have the opposite effect of beta-blockers (which are prescribed to many people with Marfan syndrome). \nv.

Clinical onset is in early childhood; the progressive course results in severe functional impairment and signifcant morbidity from chronic pain.

Low-impact physical therapy is usually well tolerated. In older adolescents and adults joint replacement has been successful in relieving hip pain and knee pain. Carpal tunnel signs, and rarely tarsal tunnel symptoms, may require surgical tendon release procedures for temporary relief. Later in the disease course when bone pain of variable intensity may become frequent, management focuses on pain relief. Bisphosphonate treatment in individuals with signifcant skeletal disease and markedly decreased bone mineral densitometry can be considered. When signifcant cardiac valvular dysfunction disrupts ventricular function, valve replacement needs to be considered. Addressing the social and emotional needs of afected individuals and their families is recommended. \nSurveillance: Yearly outpatient clinic visits (unless more frequent pain, cardiac, and/or respiratory monitoring is warranted) to assess pain level, musculoskeletal needs, gross motor and fne motor function, vision, cardiac and respiratory function, development, educational needs, psychological issues, and utilization of community resources.",

Acute, sometimes atraumatic dislocations are common. In certain types of EDS, urgent conditions may be signaled by the sudden onset of severe pain, including chest pain, or bleeding that can occur with vascular or organ (spleen, liver, colon, gravid uterus) rupture. Acute ruptures are most commonly seen in vEDS or kEDS, and more rarely in other types of EDS (D\u2019Hondt et al., 2018; Lum et al., 2011). Any acute reduction in vision or increase in ocular discomfort requires emergency ophthalmic evaluation. Rapidly progressing neurologic signs may indicate central nervous system involvement requiring urgent management (Henderson et al., 2017, 2019). Finally, the sudden onset of shortness of breath may indicate spontaneous pneumothorax, for which immediate evaluation and treatment are required. \nMonitoring for the presence of certain disease manifestations can be helpful in preventing the above emergencies by identifying early signs of pathology in asymptomatic patients. Specifically, all adult and pediatric EDS patients should undergo baseline cardiovascular evaluation. Cardiovascular assessment should include echocardiography to determine the presence and degree of cardiovascular involvement, such as valvular disease or aortic dilation (Atzinger et al., 2011). Patients with normal baseline studies and an EDS type considered low-risk for cardiovascular involvement may require fewer repeat evaluations, although no standardized interval for repeat testing has been established. Patients with abnormal findings or those with an EDS type considered high-risk for cardiovascular involvement (such as vEDS or kEDS) should be managed by a cardiovascular specialist to provide frequent monitoring and initiate specific interventions (e.g., pharmacologic, surgical) as needed. In addition, patients with many of the rarer forms of EDS have cardiovascular involvement with functional consequences necessitating lifelong specialist management (Brady et al., 2017). \n\nGiven the risk of retinal detachment, lens luxation, and cornea breakdown, all EDS patients should undergo baseline ophthalmologic evaluation that is repeated at regular intervals to assess for evidence of corneal, lenticular, scleral, or retinal involvement.",

The clinical manifestations of HCM range from asymptomatic to progressive heart failure to sudden cardiac death and vary from individual to individual even within the same family. Common symptoms include shortness of breath (particularly with exertion), chest pain, palpitations, orthostasis, presyncope, and syncope. Most often the LVH of HCM becomes apparent during adolescence or young adulthood, although it may also develop late in life, in infancy, or in childhood. \n\nManagement \nBefore identification of the genes responsible for HCM, diagnosis of HCM could only be made through integration of examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and invasive angiographic/hemodynamic studies, disproportionately identifying patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction. Genetic testing for HCM is now available and can provide important insights into family management by definitively identifying at-risk relatives (i.e., those who have inherited the family\u2019s pathogenic mutation). Mutations found are considered pathogenic based on the following criteria: (1) cosegregation with the HCM phenotype in family members; (2) previously reported or identified as a cause of HCM; (3) absent from unrelated and ethnic-matched normal controls; (4) important alteration in protein structure and function; and (5) amino acid sequence change in a region of the protein otherwise highly conserved through evolution. However, even with the use of these criteria, a considerable number of variants are classified as VUSs (see Chapter 16), making the test results ambiguous. \nBecause diagnosis and sudden cardiac death risk are both linked to the presence of LVH and because the penetrance of LVH is age-dependent, clinical evaluation must continue longitudinally. Screening is annual during adolescence and early adulthood when LVH most commonly emerges. Early childhood screening is appropriate if there is a family history of early-onset disease or other concerns. During adulthood, screening is recommended approximately every $5$ years or in response to clinical changes because LVH can develop late in life.",

You can find a doctor by: \nAsking your primary doctor for a referral   \nCalling the doctor referral service at your local   \nhospital   \nCalling your insurance provider   \nCalling our help center at 800-8MARFAN \nYou should also compile a health history for you and your family, recording: \nPast illnesses, operations, and hospitalizations   \nMedications   \nReasons you think you or your family member might   \nhave Marfan syndrome   \nFamily members who have, or might have, Marfan   \nsyndrome   \nFamily members who died of a heart or vascular   \nproblem; it is also important to understand the   \nnature or cause of the problem \nThe Role of Heredity \nWe each have two copies of most genes in each of our cells but when we have children we transmit only one copy. For disorders in which a mutation or change in one copy of a gene is sufficient to produce a clinical condition, the resulting disorder is referred to as a dominant disorder. Marfan syndrome is a dominant disorder in which one copy of the FBN1 gene has a mutation that affects the function of the protein, fibrillin-1, produced under the direction of the gene. In the situation in which one parent has the disorder, the altered copy of the gene can be inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an affected individual has a $50\\%$ chance to inherit the mutated copy and develop Marfan syndrome. If they inherit the normal copy from their affected parent, then they are not at risk to develop Marfan syndrome and, equally important, cannot pass that altered copy to their own children.",

Vaso-occlusion results from multicellular aggregates that block blood fow in small blood vessels, depriving downstream tissues of nutrients and oxygen, followed by re-perfusion injury resulting in tissue ischemia, infammation, and tissue death in the afected vascular beds. Vaso-occlusion and ischemic tissue damage cause excruciating pain. Young children more ofen report pain in their extremities, whereas older individuals more commonly experience pain in the head, chest, abdomen, and back [Brandow & DeBaun 2018]. Recurrent episodes of acute pain ultimately contribute to the development of chronic pain, likely driven by nervous system sensitization. Diagnostic criteria for chronic pain syndrome in individuals with SCD have been established [Dampier et al 2017]. It is imperative for providers to recognize the complex role of various psychosocial factors in an individual's experience of pain [Brandow & DeBaun 2018]. \n\u2022 Dactylitis (pain and/or swelling of the hands or feet) is ofen the earliest manifestation of SCD and occurs in infants and children. Te dorsa of the extremities are most ofen involved; one or all four extremities can be involved. Although immediate sequel\u00e6 are rare, dactylitis has been implicated as a risk factor for severe disease [Silva et al 2015]. \n\u2022 Splenic sequestration and infarction. Splenic sequestration occurs in $10\\%{-30\\%}$ of children with SCD, most commonly between age six months and three years, and may follow a febrile illness. Splenic sequestration is characterized by an acutely enlarging spleen with hemoglobin more than $2\\:\\mathrm{g/}$ dL below the afected individual's baseline value. Mild-to-moderate thrombocytopenia may also be present. Children with splenic sequestration may experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, or irritability. Blood transfusion may be required, as severe splenic sequestration may progress rapidly to shock and death.",
