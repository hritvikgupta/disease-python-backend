It\u2019s important to note that this is a single lead ECG and a 12-lead ECG would be ideal for a more comprehensive assessment.\n\n**Detailed Findings:**\n\n1. **Rate:** The heart rate appears to be approximately 70-75 bpm. This is within the normal range. The R-R intervals are relatively regular.\n\n2. **Rhythm:** The rhythm is sinus rhythm, meaning the heart\u2019s electrical activity originates from the sinoatrial (SA) node, which is the heart's natural pacemaker.\n\n3. **P Waves:** P waves are present and appear generally normal in morphology, although they are somewhat buried in the T wave in some leads (V5 and V6).  The P wave is present before every QRS complex, which is expected in sinus rhythm.\n\n4. **QRS Complexes:** The QRS complexes are of normal duration (less than 0.12 seconds).  The morphology is generally consistent across leads, but there are some subtle variations.\n\n5. **ST-Segment Changes:** This is the most significant finding.\n   * **Subtle ST-segment depression:** There\u2019s subtle ST-segment depression, particularly in leads V4-V6. This is the most prominent abnormality.  It's not deep, but it\u2019s present.\n   * **ST-segment elevation:** There\u2019s a small, subtle ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2.  It\u2019s difficult to definitively quantify, but it\u2019s worth noting.\n\n6. **T Waves:**\n   * **T-wave inversion:**  There are T-wave inversions present in leads V5 and V6, and also in leads I and aVL. This is a key finding, as T-wave inversion is frequently seen with myocardial ischemia.\n   * **T-wave morphology:** The T-waves themselves are somewhat peaked and slightly notched.\n\n7. **PR Interval:** The PR intervals appear to be normal in duration.\n\n8. **Axis:** The QRS axis appears to be within the normal range (approximately +60\u00b0 to +90\u00b0).\n\n9. **\n\n\n--- MEDICAL ENTITY ANALYSIS ---\n\nHISTORY: 1980-05-15\nBIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE: chest, sinoatrial, SA, node, leads, V5, 6, leads V4-V6, leads V1, V2, leads V5, V6, leads I, aVL\nSIGN_SYMPTOM: pain, ST-segment, T-wave changes, P, P waves, P wave, ST-Segment Changes, ST-segment depression, ST-segment elevation, T, T-wave inversion, T-wave inversions, wave\nDIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE: physical exam, assessment, IMAGING, ECG, heart rate, R-R intervals, Rhythm, activity, Waves, QRS Complexes, QRS complexes, morphology, T-wave morphology, -waves, PR Interval, PR intervals, QRS axis\nLAB_VALUE: P, sinus rhythm, 70-75 bpm, regular, normal, the T wave, before every QRS complex, normal duration, less than 0.12 seconds, somewhat peaked, notched, duration, within the normal range, +60\u00b0 to +90\u00b0\nDATE: 24/2025, -03-24\nDETAILED_DESCRIPTION: 21:51:25.290300, single lead, 12-lead, buried in, and V, leads\nDISEASE_DISORDER: ischemia, myocardial injury\nSEVERITY: subtle, small, slightly",

  "reasoning": "The ECG shows subtle ST-segment depression in leads V4-V6 and subtle ST-segment elevation in leads V1 and V2, along with T-wave inversions in leads V5, V6, I, and aVL. These findings are highly suggestive of myocardial ischemia.  The ST-segment changes are not sufficiently significant to meet the criteria for ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI).  The presence of T-wave inversions further supports the diagnosis of ischemia.  The reciprocal ST-segment changes (depression in V4-V6 and elevation in V1-V2) are consistent with subendocardial ischemia, a hallmark of NSTEMI.  While a 12-lead ECG would provide a more comprehensive assessment, the available single-lead ECG, coupled with the patient's chief complaint of chest pain, strongly suggests NSTEMI.  Further investigation with cardiac biomarkers (troponin levels) is crucial to confirm the diagnosis.\n\nDifferential Diagnoses:\n- {'diagnosis': 'Stable Angina', 'explanation': \"Similar ECG findings can occur with stable angina, but the absence of significant troponin elevation and the patient's lack of prior chest pain history make NSTEMI more likely.\"}\n- {'diagnosis': 'Pericarditis', 'explanation': \"Diffuse ST-segment elevation and T-wave changes can be seen in pericarditis. However, the subtle and localized nature of the ST-segment changes in this case, along with the patient's chief complaint of chest pain, makes NSTEMI more probable.\"}\n- {'diagnosis': 'Myocarditis', 'explanation': 'Myocarditis can also present with ST-segment and T-wave abnormalities.  However, the pattern and location of changes in this ECG are more suggestive of ischemia.'}\n- {'diagnosis': 'Other causes of chest pain (e.g., musculoskeletal pain, esophageal spasm, anxiety)', 'explanation': 'These conditions should be considered in the absence of definitive cardiac markers.  However, the ECG findings strongly suggest a cardiac etiology.'}",

A thorough discussion of the electrophysiological principles,ECGchanges and\u00a0clinical implications is provided. The reader should already be familiar with\u00a0theclassification of acute coronary syndromes. Subsequent chapters will deal withST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI)andnon ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (Non-STEMI, NSTEMI)in detail. Although myocardial ischemia may affect every aspect of the ECG \u2013 from heart rhythm to QTc interval \u2013 the most prominent and reliable ECG changes occur in the ST segment and the T-wave. This chapter focuses mainly onST segment deviations(ST segment depression,ST segment elevation) andT-wave changes.\n\nThe reader may wish to view the video lecture onThe ST segment, J point, J 60 point and T-waveto facilitate understanding of this chapter.\n\nThe ST segment represents the plateau phase (phase 2) of thecardiac action potential. It stretches from the J point to the onset\u00a0of the T-wave (Figure 1 A). The plateau phase has a long duration which enables the majority of the ventricular myocardium to contract simultaneously. Since\u00a0the membrane potential is relatively unchanged during the plateau phase, the potential differences in the myocardium will be small during this phase.Therefore, the ST segment should be isoelectric, which means that it should be flat and on the same level as the baseline(recall that the baseline is the level of thePR segment). Refer toFigure 1 B.\n\nThe transition from\u00a0the ST segment to\u00a0the T-wave is smooth, as is the transition between phases 2 and 3 of the action potential (Figure 1 A). The T-wave represents the rapid repolarization phase (phase 3).The T-wave is normally concordant with the QRS complex, which means that a net positive QRS complex should be\u00a0followed by a positive T-wave and vice versa (a net negative QRS complex is normally followed by a negative T-wave).\n\nBecause phase 2 and phase 3 are electrophysiologically related, changes in the ST segment are typically accompanied by\u00a0T-wave changes on the ECG.\u00a0The termST-T changesis commonly used in clinical practice to refer to changes occurring on the ST-T segment (from the J point to the end of the T-wave).\n\nIschemia affects the plateau phase (phase 2) and the rapid repolarization phase (phase 3), which is whyischemia causes changes to the ST segment and T-wave (ST-T changes). The ST segment may be either elevated or depressed. The T-wave may diminish in amplitude (flat T-waves), become negative (T-wave inversion)\u00a0or even increase markedly in amplitude (hyperacute T-wave).\n\nWhich of these ST-T changes occur depends on the localization, extension and timing of the ischemia. For example, ST-T changes early in ischemia differ from those in later phases. Moreover, a wide range of other conditions may cause similar ST-T changes and every clinician must be able to differentiate between ischemic and non-ischemic ST-T changes.\n\nMyocardial ischemia causes changes to the ST segment and T-wave (ST-T changes).\n\nIn the case of ST segment elevation or ST segment depression, the magnitude of the elevation or depression must be measured. ST segment elevation is measured from the baseline (i.e. the reference level, which is the level of the PR segment) to the J point. The J point is the point where the QRS complex ends and the ST segment starts (J stands forjunction). ST segment depression is also measured from the same baseline to the J point. Refer toFigure 1 panels B, CandD.\n\nDocument [2]: - **Journal:** American Family Physician.\n- **Year:** 2005.\n- **Summary:** Acute coronary syndrome diagnosis involves ECG evaluation for ST-segment elevation or depression, Q waves, and conduction defects.

Differential diagnoses include acute coronary syndrome, pulmonary embolism, and pneumonia[5].\n\nThese sources provide a comprehensive overview of how ECG findings, including P waves and inverted segments, are used in diagnosing cardiac conditions and differentiating them from non-cardiac causes of chest pain.\n\nDocument [3]: For example, ST-T changes early in ischemia differ from those in later phases. Moreover, a wide range of other conditions may cause similar ST-T changes and every clinician must be able to differentiate between ischemic and non-ischemic ST-T changes.\n\nMyocardial ischemia causes changes to the ST segment and T-wave (ST-T changes).\n\nIn the case of ST segment elevation or ST segment depression, the magnitude of the elevation or depression must be measured.

The J point is the point where the QRS complex ends and the ST segment starts (J stands forjunction). ST segment depression is also measured from the same baseline to the J point. Refer toFigure 1 panels B, CandD. Hence, ST segment depression implies that the J point is located below the baseline and ST segment elevation implies that the J point is located above the baseline. Refer toFigure 2.\u00a0If the PR segment is difficult to discern, one may use the TP segment (the line between the T-wave and the P-wave) as the reference level, but this is rarely needed.\n\nLog in to view image, video, quiz, text\n\nThe electrophysiological explanations for ischemic ST-T changes have been debated since year 1909 whenEppingerandRothbergerfirst described ischemic ECG changes. There is no robust theory as to why ischemia induces ST-T changes. However, it is generally acknowledged that ischemia primarily affects the repolarization\u00a0(phase 2 and phase 3) but\u00a0it also affects the resting membrane potential (phase 4), by making it less negative. Ischemia also\u00a0reduces the duration of the action potential. Hence, the action potential in ischemic myocardium will differ from that of non-ischemic myocardium. Differences in the action potential lead to electrical potential differences between normal and ischemic myocardium. These potential differences will result in electrical currents \u2013 referred to as injury currents \u2013 between normal and ischemic myocardium during systole (due to changed action potential) and diastole (due to changed resting membrane potential). It is generally accepted that these injury currents explain the emergence of ST segment elevations and depression, as well as T-wave changes.\n\nThe two main types of ischemia aretransmuralandsubendocardialischemia. Transmural ischemia implies that the entire wall\u00a0thickness \u2013from endocardium to epicardium\u2013 is affected\u00a0in the area supplied by the occluded coronary artery. In subendocardial ischemia, only the subendocardium is affected.\n\nThe injury currents in transmural ischemia (which manifests as STE-ACS and leads toSTEMI) redirect the ST vector such that it becomes directed from the endocardium to the epicardium in the ischemic area (Figure 3). This leads to ST segment elevations in the leads\u00a0which observe the ischemic area. For example, ST segment elevations in V3\u2013V4 indicate ongoing transmural ischemia located in the anterior wall of the left ventricle. The more intensive the ischemia, the greater the ST segment elevation. Similarly, the larger the affected area, the moreECG leadswill display ST segment elevation.\n\nAlthough ST-segment elevations are the hallmark of transmural ischemia, they are actually preceded byhyperacute T-waves. These T-waves are symmetric, broad-based and have\u00a0high amplitude. They occur\u00a0immediately (within seconds) following occlusion of the coronary artery. It is believed that hyperacute T-waves\u00a0are caused by\u00a0increased concentrations of potassium (along with changes in repolarization) in the ischemic area. Hyperacute T-waves have a\u00a0short duration and they diminish\u00a0within a few minutes, after which\u00a0the ST segment becomes elevated.\n\nSince hyperacute T-waves are of very short duration and they arise the moment that the occlusion occurs, it is uncommon\u00a0to spot these in clinical practice. However, clinicians who regularly see patients withchest discomfortwill certainly encounter hyperacute T-waves every now and then (ischemia is a highly dynamic process and some patients will develop a complete occlusion while monitored).\u00a0Also, note that high T-waves (but not hyperacute) may persist for a few hours following the occlusion.\n\nDocument [4]: There are a variety of other causes of ST-segment elevation on the ECG (seeTable 1) and the distinction between these entities is a combination of pattern recognition on the ECG and the clinical scenario, which are the two diagnostic points emphasized in the universal definition of STEMI. For example, ventricular aneurysms can have persistent ST-segment elevation in the leads corresponding to the aneurysmal myocardium. However, these ST-segment elevations should be present on prior ECGs and symptoms associated with the aneurysm are less likely to be consistent with acute myocardial ischemia, though they can present with ventricular arrhythmias due to the aneurysm itself or scar from prior infarctions. Myocarditis andpericarditiscan also present with ST-segment elevation and chest pain, though the ST-segment elevation is usually more diffuse and the clinical symptoms often differ from those associated with acute ischemia.10 However, there can be so-called \u2018localized\u2019 myocarditis or pericarditis, which is often a diagnosis of exclusion depending on the diagnostic modalities (cardiac MRI, etc.) available to the practitioner. Takotsubo (stress-induced) cardiomyopathy is another clinical presentation that can be confused with STEMI. These patients often present after a stressful event, which can also predispose to acute plaque ruptures. The clinical symptoms and ECG findings can be similar between the two entities, so these patients are often referred emergently to the cardiac catheterization lab and the diagnosis is one of exclusion. Transient ST elevation and Wellens\u2019 T waves also represent spectrums along the ACS spectrum, but do not definitively represent transmural myocardial infarctions and are not always managed with emergent reperfusion. These examples illustrate that, while the diagnosis of STEMI can appear objectively straightforward, there is a degree of clinical subjectivity in symptom assessment correlating with the ECG findings. In fact, prior data have shown that the sensitivity and specificity of distinguishing a true transmural infarct by ECG in the absence of clinical data were 65 % and 79 %, respectively, with an inter-reader agreement (kappa) of 0.33, reflecting poor reader agreement.11These data suggest that it is paramount to integrate the ECG data with the clinical scenario instead of solely focusing on the metrics such as door-to-balloon times, possibly compromising the ability to evaluate non-coronary etiologies of ST-segment elevation on the ECG.12,13\n\nTable 1: Differential Diagnosis of ST-segment Elevation on electrocardiogram. St Elevation Differential Diagnosis.\n\nFigure 1: Time from Initial ECG to Follow-up Diagnostic ECG in Patients with ST-segment Elevation Myocardial Infarction with an Initial Non-diagnostic ECG\n\nMany of the clinical scenarios on the differential diagnosis for chest pain and ST-segment elevation on the ECG can lead to false-positive diagnoses of STEMI that can only be excluded by coronary angiography. Some have been previously discussed, such as localized pericarditis/ myocarditis, Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, left ventricular aneurysm, and LBBB. Others include:\n\nInitial Versus Subsequent ECG Diagnosis\n\nElectrocardiographic findings during AMI can vary substantially depending on the type, stage, and extent of infarction and timing of the ECG acquisition.14\u201316A study published from the National Cardiovascular Data Registry (NCDR) Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network (ACTION)-Get With the Guidelines (GWTG) database17that evaluated 41,560 subjects from 432 sites from across the US found that 11.0 % of subjects ultimately diagnosed with STEMI had an initial non-diagnostic ECG, with a diagnostic ECG being obtained within 90 minutes in 72.4 % of this group. Times from initial non-diagnostic ECG to ECG diagnostic of STEMI in this group can be seen inFigure 1. When clinical characteristics of those patients with initial diagnostic ECG versus those with subsequent diagnostic ECGs were evaluated, it was found that there was no significant difference in time of the ECG acquisition to symptom onset or coronary artery disease risk factors. The authors concluded that ECG surveillance during the evaluation of ACS is warranted. However, determining which patients with an initial non-diagnostic ECG need additional ECG surveillance could not be ascertained from patient comorbidities or presentation characteristics alone.\n\nDocument [5]: T waves that are deep and symmetrically inverted (arrowhead) strongly suggest myocardial ischaemia.\n\nIn some patients with partial thickness ischaemia the T waves show a biphasic pattern. This occurs particularly in the anterior chest leads and is an acute phenomenon. Biphasic T wave changes usually evolve and are often followed by symmetrical T wave inversion. These changes occur in patients with unstable or crescendo angina and strongly suggest myocardial ischaemia.\n\nTypically, myocardial ischaemia gives rise to ST segment depression. The normal ST segment usually blends with the T wave smoothly, making it difficult to determine where the ST segment ends and the T wave starts. One of the first and most subtle changes in the ST segment is flattening of the segment, resulting in a more obvious angle between the ST segment and T wave.\n\nMore obvious changes comprise ST segment depression that is usually planar (horizontal) or downsloping. Whereas horizontal ST depression strongly suggests ischaemia, downsloping changes are less specific as they are also found in association with left ventricular hypertrophy and in patients taking digoxin. The degree of ST segment depression in any given lead is related to the size of the R wave. Thus, ST segment depression is usually most obvious in leads V4 to V6 of the 12 lead electrocardiogram. Moreover, because the height of the R wave varies with respiration, the degree of ST depression in any one lead may vary from beat to beat. ST segment depression is usually not as marked in the inferior leads because here the R waves tend to be smaller. Substantial (\u2a7e2 mm) and widespread (\u2a7e2 leads) ST depression is a grave prognostic finding as it implies widespread myocardial ischaemia from extensive coronary artery disease. ST segment depression may be transient, and its resolution with treatment is reassuring. Modern equipment allows continuous ST segment monitoring. Serial changes in the electrocardiogram over a few hours or days, especially when the changes are associated with recurrent chest pain, are extremely helpful in confirming the presence of ischaemic heart disease; serial changes confer a worse prognosis, indicating the need for increased drug treatment or revascularisation interventions.\n\nTransient ST segment elevation in patients with chest pain is a feature of ischaemia and is usually seen in vasospastic (variant or Prinzmetal's) angina. A proportion of these patients, however, will have substantial proximal coronary artery stenosis. When ST segment elevation has occurred and resolved it may be followed by deep T wave inversion even in the absence of enzyme evidence of myocardial damage.\n\nIn patients with previous Q wave myocardial infarction the hallmark of new ischaemia is often ST segment elevation. This is thought to be associated with a wall motion abnormality, or bulging of the infarcted segment. It rarely indicates reinfarction in the same territory. When an electrocardiogram shows persistent T wave inversion accompanying the changes of a previous acute myocardial infarction, ischaemia in the same territory may cause \u201cnormalisation\u201d of the T waves (return to an upright position). Alternatively, further ischaemia may make the T wave inversion more pronounced.\n\nVentricular myocardial ischaemia may be arrhythmogenic, and extrasystoles are common. It used to be thought that frequent extrasystoles of multifocal origin, bigeminy, couplets, or extrasystoles that fell on the T wave (R on T) conferred a bad prognosis in the early hours of myocardial infarction and predicted the onset of ventricular fibrillation. Clinical trials have clearly shown, however, that their suppression by antiarrhythmic drugs had no effect on the frequency of subsequent ventricular fibrillation.\n\nShort runs of ventricular tachycardia are a bad prognostic sign and should probably be treated\n\nVentricular fibrillation is the commonest unheralded fatal arrhythmia in the first 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction. The prognosis depends almost entirely on the patient's proximity to skilled medical help when the arrhythmia occurs. Cardiac arrest from ventricular fibrillation outside hospital is associated with a long term survival of about 10%, compared with an initial survival of 90% when cardiac arrest occurs after admission to a coronary care unit. Studies have shown that the key factor in prognosis is the speed with which electrical defibrillation is delivered.\n\nTachycardias of supraventricular origin, with the exception of atrial fibrillation, are uncommon after myocardial infarction.\n\nDocument [6]: Title: Medical Literature Summary\n\nSource: Web Search Results\n\nYear: Current\n\nContent: Here is a comprehensive overview of medical literature related to the diagnosis of chest pain, P waves, inverted segments, and relevant cardiac research:\n\n## 1. **Prolonged P-wave Duration and Cardiac Risk**\n- **Article Title:** \"Relation of Prolonged P-wave Duration to Risk of Sudden Cardiac Death\"\n- **Authors:** Not specified in the search results.\n- **Journal:** Available on PMC.\n- **Year:** Not specified in the search results.\n- **Summary:** Prolonged P-wave duration is associated with increased risk of sudden cardiac death (SCD), independent of atrial fibrillation and other cardiovascular risk factors.
