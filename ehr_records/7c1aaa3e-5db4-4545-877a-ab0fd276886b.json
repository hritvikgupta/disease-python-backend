  "input_text": "Patient: Steven Ortega, DOB: 2006-02-16, Gender: Male\n\nChief Complaint: Chest Pain\n\nSS (Subjective):\n\nPatient: Steven Ortega, DOB: 2006-02-16, Gender: Male\n\nChief Complaint: Chest Pain\n\nPatient describes no history of illness. Reports chest pain starting this morning, calling it a sharp, stabbing feeling on the left side, coming and going every 5-10 minutes. Says it\u2019s annoying as hell but denies shortness of breath, puking, or sweating. No recent bangs or bruises. No allergies or meds he\u2019s on.\n\nO (Objective):\n\n\nVitals (made up): BP 118/76 mmHg, HR 70 bpm, RR 14 breaths/min, Temp 98.7\u00b0F (37.1\u00b0C), SpO2 99% on room air.\n\nLooks fine\u2014awake, knows where he is, not freaking out.\n\nA (Assessment):\n\nGuess: Chest pain, no clue why yet\u2014maybe his ribs are pissed off, or could be his heart acting up, though he\u2019s young for that shit. Could be stress, could be nothing, could be something. Need more info.\n\nP (Plan):\n\n\nGet an ECG and chest X-ray to check his ticker and lungs. Tell him to chill out, no heavy lifting or running around. Throw him some ibuprofen, 400 mg if it\u2019s just sore muscles. Check back in a day or two, or sooner if it gets worse. Tell him if it feels like an elephant\u2019s sitting on his chest or he can\u2019t breathe, haul ass to the ER.\n\n--- IMAGING & SCANS ---\n- ECG (3/25/2025): ECG Scan for Patient\n\n--- IMAGING & SCANS ANALYSIS ---\n\n[Scan 1: ECG (2025-03-25T09:09:28.833517)]\nFile: norm.png\nDescription: ECG Scan for Patient\nAnalysis: Okay, let's analyze this ECG tracing. Here's a detailed breakdown of what I observe, incorporating relevant medical observations:\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThis ECG demonstrates sinus rhythm, but with several notable features that warrant careful consideration. There\u2019s evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and some concerning ST-T wave changes.\n\n**Detailed Analysis:**\n\n1. **Rate:** The heart rate appears to be approximately 75-80 beats per minute (BPM). It\u2019s regular. This is indicated by the consistent spacing of the R-R intervals.\n\n2. **Rhythm:** The rhythm is sinus rhythm \u2013 the electrical activity originates from the sinoatrial (SA) node, the heart\u2019s natural pacemaker.\n\n3. **P Waves:**  The P waves are generally upright in leads I, II, aVF, and V1-V6. They appear normal in morphology, although some are slightly obscured in the lower leads. \n\n4. **PR Interval:** The PR intervals are relatively short, ranging from approximately 0.14-0.16 seconds. This suggests a potentially shortened QRS duration and could be indicative of LVH.\n\n5. **QRS Duration:** The QRS complexes are relatively narrow, with a duration typically less than 0.12 seconds in most leads.\n\n6. **ST-T Wave Changes (Most Significant Finding):**\n   * **Lead V1 & V2:** There\u2019s a prominent, tall, and peaked T wave in leads V1 and V2. This is a classic sign of left ventricular hypertrophy. The T wave is elevated and often has a \u201cfishhook\u201d appearance.\n   * **Lead V5 & V6:** The T waves are also elevated, although to a lesser degree than in V1 and V2.\n   * **Lead II, III, aVF:** The T waves in these leads are inverted. This is often associated with inferior myocardial ischemia or injury. \n   * **Lead I:** The T waves are positive.\n\n7. **Axis Deviation:** The QRS axis appears to be shifted slightly to the right (approximately +45 degrees). This is consistent with the LVH.\n\n8. **Other Observations:**\n   * **Baseline:** The baseline is relatively elevated, which can be associated with hyperkalemia or other electrolyte abnormalities. \n   * **No obvious Q waves:** The absence of Q waves in the inferior leads is not\n\n\n--- MEDICAL ENTITY ANALYSIS ---\n\nDETAILED_DESCRIPTION: 2006-02-16, sharp, stabbing, side, going, room air, elephant, sitting, leads I, II, aVF, and V1-V6, lower leads, V1 & V2, peaked, fishhook, V5, V6, and V2, II, III, aVF\nBIOLOGICAL_STRUCTURE: Chest, chest, ribs, ticker, lungs, muscles, sinoatrial (SA) node, leads V1 and V2, V1, inferior, inferior leads\nSIGN_SYMPTOM: Pain, pain, shortness of breath, puking, sweating, bangs, bruises, awake, freaking out, sore, s, can, t breathe, ST-T wave changes, T wave, Q waves\nHISTORY: history of illness, allergies or meds, s on, knows where, is, heavy lifting, running\nDURATION: morning, day\nDISTANCE: 5-10, 14-0.16\nLAB_VALUE: minutes, 118/76 mmHg, 70 bpm, 14 breaths/min, 98.7\u00b0F, 99%, sinus rhythm, 75-80 beats per minute, BPM, regular, upright, normal, obscured, short, 0., seconds, narrow, less, 0.12 seconds, tall, elevated, inverted, positive, shifted, to the right, +45 degrees\nDIAGNOSTIC_PROCEDURE: Vitals, BP, HR, RR, Temp, SpO2, ECG, X-ray, heart rate, R-R intervals, P Waves, P waves, PR Interval, PR intervals, QRS, QRS Duration, QRS complexes, ST-T Wave Changes, T wave, T waves, Axis Deviation, QRS axis, baseline\nDISEASE_DISORDER: off, heart, up, stress, left ventricular hypertrophy, LVH, ischemia, injury, H, hyperkalemia, electrolyte abnormalities\nTHERAPEUTIC_PROCEDURE: out\nMEDICATION: ibuprofen\nDOSAGE: 400 mg\nDATE: or two, 3/25/2025, 2025-03-25, 09:09\nNONBIOLOGICAL_LOCATION: ER",

      "contents": "--- WEB CONTEXT FROM PERPLEXITY AI ---\n\n## Clinical Risk Assessment\n\nGiven the conditions and symptoms described, the patient is at significant risk for various cardiovascular and metabolic complications. Here's a detailed assessment of these risks along with evidence-based preventive measures:\n\n### Cardiovascular Risks\n\n1. **Heart Failure and Sudden Death**\n   - **Risk Level:** High\n   - **Reason:** Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is a major risk factor for heart failure and sudden death, especially in the context of hypertension and ischemia[2].\n   - **Preventive Measures:** Control blood pressure using ACE inhibitors or ARBs, reduce sodium intake, and manage weight[2].\n\n2. **Myocardial Infarction (MI)**\n   - **Risk Level:** High\n   - **Reason:** Ischemia and LVH increase the risk of MI[1][2].\n   - **Preventive Measures:** Lifestyle modifications (diet, exercise), smoking cessation, and management of hypertension and dyslipidemia[1].\n\n3. **Stroke**\n   - **Risk Level:** Moderate to High\n   - **Reason:** Presence of hypertension and LVH[1][2].\n   - **Preventive Measures:** Similar to those for MI, with emphasis on blood pressure control[1].\n\n### Metabolic Risks\n\n1. **Metabolic Syndrome**\n   - **Risk Level:** Moderate\n   - **Reason:** Association between LVH and metabolic syndrome components like insulin resistance[2][3].\n   - **Preventive Measures:** Aggressive lifestyle changes including diet and exercise to manage weight and improve insulin sensitivity[5].\n\n### Overall Health Risks\n\n1. **Medication-Related Risks**\n   - **Risk Level:** Moderate\n   - **Reason:** Ibuprofen can increase the risk of heart attack and stroke, especially in patients with pre-existing heart disease[4].\n   - **Preventive Measures:** Use the smallest effective dose for the shortest duration necessary, consider alternative pain management strategies like acetaminophen or topical NSAIDs[4].\n\n2. **Acute Symptoms**\n   - **Risk Level:** High\n   - **Reason:** Shortness of breath, vomiting, sweating, and ECG findings suggestive of cardiac issues indicate acute distress[3].\n   - **Preventive Measures:** Immediate medical evaluation and intervention are necessary to address these acute symptoms.\n\n### Clinical Findings and Symptoms\n\n- **Shortness of Breath, Vomiting, Sweating, Bangs, Bruises:**\n  - These symptoms suggest acute distress and possible cardiac involvement. Immediate medical attention is required to assess and manage these symptoms.\n\n- **Abnormal Laboratory Values and ECG Findings:**\n  - These findings are indicative of cardiac issues and necessitate thorough evaluation and appropriate management.\n\n### Evidence-Based Preventive Measures\n\n1. **Lifestyle Modifications:**\n   - **Diet:** Focus on a heart-healthy diet low in sodium and saturated fats.\n   - **Exercise:** Regular physical activity to manage weight and improve cardiovascular health.\n   - **Stress Management:** Techniques like meditation or yoga can help reduce stress levels.\n\n2. **Medication Management:**\n   - Ensure that all medications are used under medical supervision, especially NSAIDs\n\nSOURCES:\n- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10617200/\n- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3132610/\n- https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5393930/\n- https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-attack/expert-answers/nsaids-heart-attack-stroke/faq-20147557\n- https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/metabolic-syndrome/symptoms-causes/syc-20351916\n\n"
