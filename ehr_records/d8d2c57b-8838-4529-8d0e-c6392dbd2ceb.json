  "reasoning": "John Doe presents with a constellation of symptoms including tall stature, long limbs, chest pain, and blurred vision.  While these symptoms individually could have various causes, their combination raises suspicion for a connective tissue disorder, most notably Marfan syndrome.  The provided literature mentions Marfan syndrome and its diagnostic process, emphasizing the need for a thorough clinical evaluation including a detailed medical and family history, a complete physical examination, an ophthalmological examination, and an electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram.  The literature also suggests that genetic testing may be helpful in some situations to confirm the diagnosis. Given the potential severity and life-threatening complications associated with Marfan syndrome, genetic testing is warranted to confirm or rule out the diagnosis and guide appropriate management.  The literature does not provide sufficient information to diagnose John Doe with any other specific rare genetic disease based on the provided symptoms. The other rare genetic diseases mentioned in the literature have significantly different symptom profiles that do not align with John Doe's presentation.",

THIS ARCHIVAL VERSION IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. \nClinical characteristics \nCongenital fber-type disproportion (CFTD) is usually characterized by hypotonia and mild-to-severe generalized muscle weakness at birth or within the frst year of life. Although some individuals remain nonambulatory throughout life, many eventually develop the ability to walk. In more than $90\\%$ of afecte d individuals, muscle weakness is static or improves; in the remainder it is usually slowly progressive. Mild-tosevere respiratory involvement is seen in approximately $30\\%$ of afected individuals; respiratory failure may occur at any age. Ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and facial and/or bulbar weakness with severe limb/respiratory weakness may predict a poor prognosis. Mild-to-severe feeding difculties occur in nearly $30\\%$ of children. Contractures of the hips, knees, ankles, elbows, and fngers occur in approximately $25\\%$ and may be present at birth or occur in older persons with decreased mobility secondary to severe weakness. Spinal deformities including scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis, and lordosis are seen in $25\\%$ or more of individuals. \nDiagnosis/testing \nDiagnosis is based on a combination of clinical presentation and morphologic features observed on skeletal muscle histology. Te pathologic and clinical manifestations of CFTD overlap with other neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular diseases that must be ruled out prior to making a diagnosis of CFTD. To date, pathogenic \n",

(There is also an autosomal dominant form.) Whether Bruce\u2019s mother was affected is unknown. Dorothy and Steven have three unaffected children: a daughter, Elsie, and two sons, Zack and Peter. Elsie is planning to have children in the near future. Dorothy wonders whether she should warn Elsie about the risk that she might be a carrier of a serious eye disorder. Sketch the pedigree, and answer the following. \na. What is the chance that Elsie is heterozygous?   \nb. An ophthalmologist traces the family history in further detail and finds evidence that in this pedigree, the disorder is not X-linked but autosomal dominant.

In the early to mid twentieth century, physicians described people with similar skeletal features as well as problems affecting the heart and blood vessels, eyes, lungs, central nervous system, skin and teeth. Today, when seen enough in combination, these features have come to be known as Marfan syndrome. There are also a number of related disorders that have many of the same features. \nBecause it affects so many parts of the body, Marfan syndrome is very complicated. It is difficult to diagnose and calls for treatment by many different medical specialists. It also affects people differently\u2014some have all of its features, while others have only a few. Some people experience severe problems and other people feel its effects only lightly. However, because it is potentially life-threatening, it should never be taken lightly, now matter how mild the symptoms. \nThis book was created to help readers understand the basics of Marfan syndrome diagnosis and treatment, as well to provide guidance on the lifestyle and practical issues commonly encountered by people with Marfan syndrome or a related disorder.

Additional features may include psychomotor delay, hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, short stature, and various skeletal abnormalities. Children with MSS usually present with muscular hypotonia in early infancy; distal and proximal muscular weakness is noticed during the frst decade of life. Later, cerebellar fndings of truncal ataxia, dysdiadochokinesia, nystagmus, and dysarthria become apparent. Motor function worsens progressively for some years, then stabilizes at an unpredictable age and degree of severity. Cataracts can develop rapidly and typically require lens extraction in the frst decade of life. Although many adults have severe disabilities, life span in MSS appears to be near normal. \nDiagnosis/testing \nDiagnosis is established in an individual with typical clinical fndings and/or biallelic pathogenic variants of SIL1 identifed on molecular genetic testing. Electron-microscopic ultrastructural changes on muscle biopsy are thought to be specifc to MSS. \nManagement \nTreatment of manifestations: Symptomatic treatment of muscular manifestations usually by pediatric or adult neurologists and physiatrists and/or physical therapists; education programs tailored to the individual's developmental needs; cataract extraction as needed; hormone replacement therapy for primary gonadal failure at the expected time of puberty. \nSurveillance: Regular follow up with a child or adult neurologist and physiatrist and/or physical therapist;   \nophthalmologic examination at regular intervals beginning in infancy. \nGenetic counseling \nMarinesco-Sj\u00f6gren syndrome (MSS) is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner.

There was no history of fever, infection, or trauma, and her medical history was otherwise unremarkable; findings from the previous visit were normal except for a low hemoglobin level and a mildly enlarged spleen. Findings from the physical examination were normal except for a palpable spleen tip and swollen feet. Her feet were tender to palpation, and she would not stand up. Both parents had siblings who died in childhood of infection and others who may have had sickle cell disease. In view of this history and the recurrent painful swelling of her feet, her physician tested C.W. for sickle cell disease by hemoglobin electrophoresis. This test result documented sickle cell hemoglobin, Hb S, in C.W. \nBACKGROUND \nDisease Etiology and Incidence \nSickle cell disease (MIM 603903) is an autosomal recessive disorder of hemoglobin in which the $\\upbeta$ subunit genes have a missense mutation that substitutes valine for glutamic acid at amino acid 6. The disease is most commonly due to homozygosity for the sickle cell mutation, although compound heterozygosity for the sickle allele and a hemoglobin C or a $\\upbeta$ -thalassemia allele can also cause sickle cell disease (see Chapter 11). The prevalence of sickle cell disease varies widely among populations in proportion to past and present exposure to malaria (see Table). The sickle cell mutation appears to confer some resistance to malaria and thus a survival advantage to individuals heterozygous for the mutation. \nPathogenesis \nHemoglobin is composed of four subunits, two $\\upalpha$ subunits encoded by HBA on chromosome 16 and two $\\upbeta$ subunits encoded by the HBB gene on chromosome 11 (see Chapter 11).",

Short stature may be present at birth or develop in early infancy. Individuals may present with short limbs and/or short trunk. Radiographic features include enlargement and corner fracture-like lesions of the metaphyses, developmental coxa vara, shortened long bones, scoliosis, and vertebral anomalies. Limited joint mobility and chronic pain are common. Vision impairment and glaucoma have been reported. \nDiagnosis/testing \nTe diagnosis of SMDCF is established in a proband with characteristic clinical and radiographic features including short stature, corner fracture-like lesions, developmental coxa vara, and vertebral anomalies. Identifcation of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COL2A1 or FN1 by molecular genetic testing can confr m the diagnosis if radiographic features are inconclusive. \nManagement \nTreatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for scoliosis per orthopedist; surgical treatment for coxa vara, genu valgum or varum, bowing of the tibia, leg length discrepancy, atlantoaxial instability per orthopedist; management of mobility issues and chronic joint pain by orthopedist and/or physiatrist and physiotherapist; management of vision impairment and glaucoma per ophthalmologist; management of psychosocial issues by a psychotherapist or referral to support groups. \nSurveillance: Annual evaluation by an orthopedist and/or physiatrist for scoliosis, other orthopedic complications, and mobility issues. Annual evaluation of intraocular pressure and blood pressure in individuals with FN1-SMDCF. Annual screening for psychosocial issues. \n",

People with Marfan syndrome have a $50\\%$ chance of passing the mutation on each time they have a child. \nPeople are born with Marfan syndrome but may not notice any features until later in life. Marfan syndrome features can appear at any age, including in infants and young children. They often get worse as people age. \n3. WHAT IS THE PROGNOSIS FOR PEOPLE WITH MARFAN SYNDROME? \nThere is no cure for Marfan syndrome, but with early diagnosis, proper treatment and careful management of the disorder, it is possible for people to live a normal life span. The outlook today for people with Marfan syndrome is far brighter than it was a few decades ago. In the days before open-heart surgery, the average life expectancy was reduced by a third. Now, early diagnosis and careful management have greatly improved the prognosis and increased life expectancy. Medical and surgical treatments continue to improve and offer hope to even the most severely affected infants, children and adults. In addition, proper management can relieve or prevent many of the complications that interfere with daily activities. \n1.HOW IS MARFAN SYNDROME DIAGNOSED? \nAlthough scientists have determined that Marfan syndrome is caused by a variation in the fibrillin-1 gene on chromosome 15, there is no simple test that can conclusively diagnose Marfan syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is made primarily through a clinical evaluation. Genetic testing may be helpful in some situations (see page 22). \nBecause most features of Marfan syndrome progress with age, the diagnosis is often more obvious in teens or adults. But children, even newborns, can and should be examined. For these reasons, the diagnostic evaluation should be performed by physicians experienced with the condition. The evaluation should include: \nA detailed medical and family history.   \nA complete physical examination.   \nA thorough eye examination by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) using a slit lamp to look for lens dislocation after fully dilating the pupil.   \nAn electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiogram to look for involvement of the cardiovascular system that may be not evident from the physical examination. \n",

She has visited the ER multiple times and has been hospitalized. An extensive evaluation has failed to yield a diagnosis. The patient does some web research, finding that her symptoms are a match for porphyria. Her conclusion about the diagnosis is reinforced by a \u201curine porphyrin screen\u201d, which reveals a coproporphyrin level that is twice the upper limit of normal. Her physicians agree that the clinical picture and lab findings are consistent with acute porphyria, specifically HCP. They proceed to manage her pain episodes with opiates, glucose infusion, and intravenous hematin. The results are variable and often unimpressive.  Symptom relief, when achieved, is of short duration \u2013 hours to a few days only. Overall the attacks become more frequent, to the point that pain is present on most days. Her use of opiates escalates, raising questions of narcotic dependence. She pursues a high-carbohydrate diet, having read that this may preempt symptoms in porphyria, and gains 90 lb. She is unable to work. She is referred to a porphyria specialist, who obtains genetic testing. The results are negative for any form of acute porphyria. \nThe history illustrates that misdiagnosis of HCP can have life-altering consequences. ",

Once the GLA pathogenic variant has been identifed in an afected family member, molecular genetic testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible. \nGeneReview Scope \nFabry Disease: Included Phenotypes \nClassic Fabry disease Atypical & late-onset variants of Fabry disease \nDiagnosis \nSuggestive Findings \nFabry disease typically afects more than one organ system and should be suspected in males and females with the following clinical features, particularly if more than one is present: \n\u2022 Vascular cutaneous lesions (angiokeratomas)   \n\u2022 Periodic crises of severe pain in the extremities (acroparesthesia)   \n\u2022 Sweating abnormalities (hypohidrosis, anhidrosis, or rarely hyperhidrosis)   \n\u2022 Cornea verticillata (characteristic corneal opacity) and lenticular opacities   \n\u2022 Unexplained lef ventricular hypertrophy or cardiac arrhythmia   \nUnexplained stroke   \n",

      "contents": "Children with USH2 are ofen misdiagnosed as having nonsyndromic hearing impairment until tunnel vision and night blindness (early signs of RP) become severe enough to be noticeable, either by parents and teachers or by the individual. Te onset of RP in individuals with USH2 is variable but typically starts in late adolescence or early adulthood and occasionally can start much earlier. RP is progressive, bilateral, symmetric photoreceptor degeneration of the retina that initiates in the mid-periphery; rods (photoreceptors active in the dark-adapted state) are mainly afected frst, causing night blindness and constricted visual felds (tunnel vision). Cones (photoreceptors active in the light-adapted state) are afected second and eventually die and cause central blindness. Contrast sensitivities, color vision, and mobility may become severely afected as the retinal degeneration progresses. \nVisual felds become progressively constricted with time. Te rate and degree of visual feld loss show intra- and interfamilial variability. A visual feld of 5-10 degrees (\"severe tunnel\") is common for a person with USH2 at age 30-40 years. Visual impairment worsens signifcantly each year [Iannaccone et al 2004, Pennings et al 2004]. Individuals with USH2 may become completely blind. Cataracts and/or cystoid macular edema sometimes reduce central vision. Tese two associated conditions are treatable. \nVestibular Loss \nVestibular loss has been identifed in $40\\%{-}80\\%$ of individuals with USH2 in a small study of specialized vestibular testing [Magliulo et al 2017].
