    "reasoning": "John Doe presents with a constellation of symptoms including tall stature, long limbs, chest pain, and blurred vision.  These symptoms raise suspicion for a heritable connective tissue disorder, such as Marfan syndrome. While the provided literature does not directly discuss Marfan syndrome, it extensively details the diagnostic approach to heritable disorders of connective tissue, emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive genetic and physical examination.  The literature highlights the need for ophthalmological assessment to evaluate lens, retina, and vitreous abnormalities, as well as radiographic imaging (echocardiography) to assess the aortic root.  John Doe's chest pain and blurred vision specifically warrant these investigations. The absence of a reported family history does not rule out a genetic etiology, as some genetic conditions can arise de novo. Given the potential severity of undiagnosed connective tissue disorders and the availability of genetic testing to confirm or refute a diagnosis, genetic testing is strongly recommended.",

Further complicating differentiation between AR and AD WMS based on family history, some heterozygotes for AR WMS display mild clinical manifestations of the disease, including short stature, brachydactyly, and abnormal gonioscopic findings. In addition to the eye manifestations listed in Table 2 (Supplemental Digital Content 2, http://links.lww.com/GIM/A112), shallow orbits and glaucoma can be features of WMS. Congenital cardiac abnormalities reported for patients with WMS include MVP, prolonged QT interval, and pulmonary and aortic valve stenoses. Patients with WMS and a history of palpitation, lightheadedness, dizziness or syncope should be evaluated for prolonged QTc, as it may be associated with serious arrhythmia.98 The differential diagnosis of WMS includes Hunter-MacDonald Syndrome.99 \n\nDISCUSSION \nThe cornerstones for establishing a diagnosis are a personal medical history, a family history extended through third-degree relatives, and a comprehensive genetics physical examination, with special attention to potential dysmorphic features, cardiac murmurs, body proportions, joint mobility, and skin characteristics. This article is meant to help guide the development of an informed differential diagnosis and suggest possible targets for further clinical evaluation and genetic testing. Considerations for specific testing in heritable disorders of connective tissue may include the following: \n\u25cf Evaluation by an ophthalmologist with knowledge of disorders of connective tissue to assess abnormalities of the lens, retina, vitreous, and refraction.   \n\u25cf Radiographic imaging, including transthoracic or esophageal echocardiography, with careful, serial measurements of the aortic root at the level of the sinuses of Valsalva to compare with normal references for age and/or body mass index and evaluation of the aortic arch.   \n\u25cf CT or MR angiogram of the cerebral, neck, thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic arteries.",

Although some individuals remain nonambulatory throughout life, many eventually develop the ability to walk. In more than $90\\%$ of afecte d individuals, muscle weakness is static or improves; in the remainder it is usually slowly progressive. Mild-tosevere respiratory involvement is seen in approximately $30\\%$ of afected individuals; respiratory failure may occur at any age. Ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and facial and/or bulbar weakness with severe limb/respiratory weakness may predict a poor prognosis. Mild-to-severe feeding difculties occur in nearly $30\\%$ of children. Contractures of the hips, knees, ankles, elbows, and fngers occur in approximately $25\\%$ and may be present at birth or occur in older persons with decreased mobility secondary to severe weakness. Spinal deformities including scoliosis, kyphoscoliosis, and lordosis are seen in $25\\%$ or more of individuals. \nDiagnosis/testing \nDiagnosis is based on a combination of clinical presentation and morphologic features observed on skeletal muscle histology. Te pathologic and clinical manifestations of CFTD overlap with other neuromuscular and non-neuromuscular diseases that must be ruled out prior to making a diagnosis of CFTD. To date, pathogenic \n",

There was no history of fever, infection, or trauma, and her medical history was otherwise unremarkable; findings from the previous visit were normal except for a low hemoglobin level and a mildly enlarged spleen. Findings from the physical examination were normal except for a palpable spleen tip and swollen feet. Her feet were tender to palpation, and she would not stand up. Both parents had siblings who died in childhood of infection and others who may have had sickle cell disease. In view of this history and the recurrent painful swelling of her feet, her physician tested C.W. for sickle cell disease by hemoglobin electrophoresis. This test result documented sickle cell hemoglobin, Hb S, in C.W. \nBACKGROUND \nDisease Etiology and Incidence \nSickle cell disease (MIM 603903) is an autosomal recessive disorder of hemoglobin in which the $\\upbeta$ subunit genes have a missense mutation that substitutes valine for glutamic acid at amino acid 6. The disease is most commonly due to homozygosity for the sickle cell mutation, although compound heterozygosity for the sickle allele and a hemoglobin C or a $\\upbeta$ -thalassemia allele can also cause sickle cell disease (see Chapter 11). The prevalence of sickle cell disease varies widely among populations in proportion to past and present exposure to malaria (see Table). The sickle cell mutation appears to confer some resistance to malaria and thus a survival advantage to individuals heterozygous for the mutation. \nPathogenesis \nHemoglobin is composed of four subunits, two $\\upalpha$ subunits encoded by HBA on chromosome 16 and two $\\upbeta$ subunits encoded by the HBB gene on chromosome 11 (see Chapter 11).",

Te range in age of onset is from 19 to 73 years. Te mean age of onset is between 43 and 52 years. Age of onset and clinical picture vary even within the same family; sibs with the same size full-penetrance allele may difer in age of onset by as much as 12 years, or exhibit, at least initially, an episodic course [Gomez et al 1997, Jodice et al 1997]. \nInitial symptoms are gait unsteadiness, stumbling, and imbalance in approximately $90\\%$ of individuals; the remainder present with dysarthria. Symptoms progress slowly, and eventually all persons have gait ataxia, upperlimb incoordination, intention tremor, and dysarthria.

Te cardinal feature of ATTR-amyloid neuropathy is slowly progressive sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy [Ando et al 2005]. Typically, sensory neuropathy starts in the lower extremities and is followed by motor neuropathy within a few years. Te initial signs of this sensory neuropathy are paresthesias (sense of burning, shooting pain) and hypesthesias of the feet.

She has visited the ER multiple times and has been hospitalized. An extensive evaluation has failed to yield a diagnosis. The patient does some web research, finding that her symptoms are a match for porphyria. Her conclusion about the diagnosis is reinforced by a \u201curine porphyrin screen\u201d, which reveals a coproporphyrin level that is twice the upper limit of normal. Her physicians agree that the clinical picture and lab findings are consistent with acute porphyria, specifically HCP. They proceed to manage her pain episodes with opiates, glucose infusion, and intravenous hematin. The results are variable and often unimpressive.  Symptom relief, when achieved, is of short duration \u2013 hours to a few days only. Overall the attacks become more frequent, to the point that pain is present on most days. Her use of opiates escalates, raising questions of narcotic dependence. She pursues a high-carbohydrate diet, having read that this may preempt symptoms in porphyria, and gains 90 lb. She is unable to work. She is referred to a porphyria specialist, who obtains genetic testing. The results are negative for any form of acute porphyria. \nThe history illustrates that misdiagnosis of HCP can have life-altering consequences. ",

Te peak age of onset in LHON is in the second and third decades of life, with $90\\%$ of those who lose their vision doing so before age 50 years. Very rarely, individuals frst manifest LHON in the seventh and eighth decades of life.

Identifcation of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in COL2A1 or FN1 by molecular genetic testing can confr m the diagnosis if radiographic features are inconclusive. \nManagement \nTreatment of manifestations: Standard treatment for scoliosis per orthopedist; surgical treatment for coxa vara, genu valgum or varum, bowing of the tibia, leg length discrepancy, atlantoaxial instability per orthopedist; management of mobility issues and chronic joint pain by orthopedist and/or physiatrist and physiotherapist; management of vision impairment and glaucoma per ophthalmologist; management of psychosocial issues by a psychotherapist or referral to support groups. \nSurveillance: Annual evaluation by an orthopedist and/or physiatrist for scoliosis, other orthopedic complications, and mobility issues. Annual evaluation of intraocular pressure and blood pressure in individuals with FN1-SMDCF. Annual screening for psychosocial issues. \n",
