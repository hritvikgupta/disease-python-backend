    "reasoning": "Robert Smith is a 65-year-old male presenting with mild chest pain on exertion and occasional shortness of breath.  His medical history includes hypertension diagnosed at age 50 and a 30-year smoking history. He has been diagnosed with suspected stable angina secondary to coronary artery disease.  The provided literature describes various genetic conditions, many of which can manifest with cardiovascular symptoms. However, Robert's presentation is typical of stable angina, a common condition strongly associated with risk factors like hypertension and smoking.  There is no family history of genetic disorders or early-onset diseases, which reduces the likelihood of a rare inherited condition. While some rare genetic diseases like hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) can present later in life, the absence of a family history and the classic presentation of stable angina make genetic testing for HCM or other rare genetic cardiovascular diseases less likely to yield clinically useful information.  The cost and potential for ambiguous results (VUS) associated with genetic testing for rare conditions outweigh the benefits in this case.  Focusing on managing his known risk factors (hypertension, smoking) and established diagnosis (stable angina) is the most appropriate course of action.",

The clinical manifestations of HCM range from asymptomatic to progressive heart failure to sudden cardiac death and vary from individual to individual even within the same family. Common symptoms include shortness of breath (particularly with exertion), chest pain, palpitations, orthostasis, presyncope, and syncope. Most often the LVH of HCM becomes apparent during adolescence or young adulthood, although it may also develop late in life, in infancy, or in childhood. \n\nManagement \nBefore identification of the genes responsible for HCM, diagnosis of HCM could only be made through integration of examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and invasive angiographic/hemodynamic studies, disproportionately identifying patients with left ventricular outflow obstruction. Genetic testing for HCM is now available and can provide important insights into family management by definitively identifying at-risk relatives (i.e., those who have inherited the family\u2019s pathogenic mutation). Mutations found are considered pathogenic based on the following criteria: (1) cosegregation with the HCM phenotype in family members; (2) previously reported or identified as a cause of HCM; (3) absent from unrelated and ethnic-matched normal controls; (4) important alteration in protein structure and function; and (5) amino acid sequence change in a region of the protein otherwise highly conserved through evolution. However, even with the use of these criteria, a considerable number of variants are classified as VUSs (see Chapter 16), making the test results ambiguous. \nBecause diagnosis and sudden cardiac death risk are both linked to the presence of LVH and because the penetrance of LVH is age-dependent, clinical evaluation must continue longitudinally. Screening is annual during adolescence and early adulthood when LVH most commonly emerges. Early childhood screening is appropriate if there is a family history of early-onset disease or other concerns. During adulthood, screening is recommended approximately every $5$ years or in response to clinical changes because LVH can develop late in life.",

Twin studies also support a role for genetic variants in CAD (Table 8-11). \nA few mendelian disorders leading to CAD are known. Familial hypercholesterolemia      (Case 16), an autosomal dominant defect of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor discussed in Chapter 12, is one of the most common of these but accounts for only approximately $5\\,\\%$ of survivors of MI. Most cases of CAD show multifactorial inheritance, with both nongenetic and genetic predisposing factors. There are many stages in the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary artery. What begins as a fatty streak in the intima of the artery evolves into a fibrous plaque containing smooth muscle, lipid, and fibrous tissue. These intimal plaques become vascular and may bleed, ulcerate, and calcify, thereby causing severe vessel narrowing as well as providing fertile ground for thrombosis, resulting in sudden, complete occlusion and MI. Given the many stages in the evolution of atherosclerotic lesions in the coronary artery, it is not surprising that many genetic differences affecting the various pathological processes involved could predispose to or protect from CAD (Fig. 8-6; also see Box). Additional risk factors for CAD include other disorders that are themselves multifactorial with genetic components, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus. The metabolic and physiological derangements represented by these disorders also contribute to enhancing the risk for CAD. Finally, diet, physical activity, systemic inflammation, and smoking are environmental factors that also play a major role in influencing the risk for CAD. Given all the different processes, metabolic derangements, and environmental factors that contribute to the development of CAD, it is easy to imagine that genetic susceptibility to CAD could be a complex multifactorial condition (see Box). \n\nGENES AND GENE PRODUCTS INVOLVED IN THE STEPWISE PROCESS OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE \nA large number of genes and gene products have been suggested and, in some cases, implicated in promoting one or more of the developmental stages of coronary artery disease.

First, careful elucidation of any family history of acute aortic events, including sudden unexplained death at a young age, is important in establishing a clear heritable aortopathy. Echocardiographic screening of the aorta in first-degree relatives can be a useful and affordable tool for establishing the prevalence of aortic dilatation within the family, both solidifying a diagnosis of an inherited aortopathy and identifying at-risk family members who will require more regular aortic surveillance (Figure\u00a0 3).

The heterozygous form of the disease, with a population frequency of approximately 2 per 1000, is one of the most common single-gene disorders. Heterozygotes have levels of plasma cholesterol that are approximately twice those of controls (see Fig. 12-13). Because of the inherited nature of familial hypercholesterolemia, it is important to make the diagnosis in the approximately $5\\,\\%$ of survivors of premature $\\because\\leq\\!50$ years of age) myocardial infarction who are heterozygotes for an LDL receptor defect. It is important to stress, however, that, among those in the general population with plasma cholesterol concentrations above the 95th percentile for age and sex, only approximately 1 in 20 has familial hypercholesterolemia; most such individuals have an uncharacterized hypercholesterolemia due to multiple common genetic variants, as presented in Chapter 8. \n\nCholesterol Uptake by the LDL Receptor. Normal cells obtain cholesterol from either de novo synthesis or the uptake from plasma of exogenous cholesterol bound to lipoproteins, especially LDL. The majority of LDL uptake is mediated by the LDL receptor, which recognizes apoprotein B-100, the protein moiety of LDL. LDL receptors on the cell surface are localized to invaginations (coated pits) lined by the protein clathrin (Fig. 12-14). Receptor-bound LDL is brought into the cell by endocytosis of the coated pits, which ultimately evolve into lysosomes in which LDL is hydrolyzed to release free cholesterol. The increase in free intracellular cholesterol reduces endogenous cholesterol formation by suppressing the rate-limiting enzyme of the synthetic pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase.",

One striking aspect of bipolar disease in families is that the condition has variable expressivity; some members of the same family demonstrate classic bipolar illness, others have depression alone (unipolar disorder), and others carry a diagnosis of a psychiatric syndrome that involves both thought and mood (schizoaffective disorder). Even less is known about genes and alleles that predispose to bipolar disease than is known for schizophrenia; in particular, although an increase in de novo deletions or duplications has been identified in bipolar psychosis, recurrent CNVs involving particular regions of the genome have not been identified. Counseling therefore typically relies on empirical risk figures (see Table 8-9). \nCoronary Artery Disease \nCoronary artery disease (CAD) kills approximately 500,000 individuals in the United States yearly and is one of the most frequent causes of morbidity and mortality in the developed world. CAD due to atherosclerosis is the major cause of the nearly 1,500,000 cases of myocardial infarction (MI) and the more than 200,000 deaths from acute MI occurring annually. In the aggregate, CAD costs more than $\\mathbb{S}143$ billion in health care expenses alone each year in the United States, not including lost productivity. For unknown reasons, males are at higher risk for CAD both in the general population and within affected families. \nFamily studies have repeatedly supported a role for heredity in CAD, particularly when it occurs in relatively young individuals. The pattern of increased risk suggests that when the proband is female or young, there is likely to be a greater genetic contribution to MI in the family, thereby increasing the risk for disease in the proband\u2019s relatives. For example, the recurrence risk (Table 8-10) in male first-degree relatives of a female proband is sevenfold greater than that in the general population, compared with the 2.5-fold increased risk in female relatives of a male proband. When the proband is young $(<\\!55$ years) and female, the risk for CAD is more than 11 times greater than that of the general population.",

In a registry of patients with FMD, $2\\%$ of patients developed an aortic aneurysm, higher than would be expected in a predominantly young, non-smoking female population.64,65 The development of FMD is thought to be multifactorial with genetic and environmental influences.63,66 In a recent genome-wide association study, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the PHACTR1 locus conferred an odds ratio of 1.3 for FMD.67 This locus is also associated with coronary artery disease, migraine, and cervical artery dissection.67 Further studies are needed to clarify the genetic basis for FMD. \nIn addition to the disease processes described above, a number of other non-heritable disorders are implicated in aneurysm formation, including: tobacco use, renin-angiotensinaldosterone system mediated aneurysms, vasculitides, atherosclerosis and infections of the aortic wall. Table 1 outlines some of the key heritable aortopathies. \nAn approach to diagnosis \nIn making the diagnosis of heritable aortopathies, an approach to history taking and physical exam, as well as knowledge of when to screen patients for these genetic disorders, is important. Heritable TAAs often occur in younger patients without apparent risk factors for atherosclerotic disease. \nA detailed family history is paramount in making the diagnosis of heritable TAAs. The Modified Ghent criteria for MFS highlights this fact with separate criteria for the diagnosis of MFS in patients with family history compared to isolated non-familial cases.",

Enlargement of the heart can also result in diminished lung volume, atelectasis, and sometimes bronchial compression. Progressive deposition of glycogen results in conduction defects as seen by shortening of the PR interval on EKG. \nIn untreated infants, death commonly occurs in the frst two years of life from cardiopulmonary insufcienc y [van den Hout et al 2003, Kishnani et al 2006a]. \nDeath from ventilatory failure typically occurs in early childh \nLOPD can manifest at various ages with muscle weakness and respiratory insufciency. Disease progression is ofen predicted by the age of onset, as progression is more rapid if symptoms are evident in childhood. \nWhile initial manifestations in late childhood-onset to adolescent-onset Pompe disease do not typically include cardiac complications, some adults with late-onset disease have had arteriopathy, including dilatation of the ascending thoracic aorta [El-Gharbawy et al 2011]. Of note, echocardiography alone (without spe cifc measurement of the diameter of the thoracic aorta) may not be sufcient to visualize this complication. In addition, ectasia of the basilar and internal carotid arteries may be associated with clinical signs, such as transient ischemic attacks and third nerve paralysis [Sacconi et al 2010]. \nProgression of skeletal muscle involvement is slower than in the infantile forms and eventually involves the diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscles [Winkel et al 2005]. Afected individuals ofen become wheelchair users because of lower limb weakness. Respiratory failure causes the major morbidity and mortality [Hagemans et al 2005, G\u00fcng\u00f6r et al 2011]. Male sex, severity of skeletal muscle weakness, and duration of disease are all risk factors for severe respiratory insufciency [van der Beek et al 2011]. \n",

Te individual complains of painful breathing, and breath sounds are diminished on the afected side. Radiographs may reveal a small exudate in the costophrenic angle. Attacks resolve within 48 hours. Pleuritis can rarely be the sole manifestation of FMF [Lega et al 2010, Ruiz & Gadea 2011]. \n\u2022 Pericarditis, a rare occurrence, is characterized by retrosternal pain. Electrocardiogram shows an elevated ST segment. Radiographs may reveal transient enlargement of the cardiac silhouette, and echocardiography may show evidence of pericardial efusion. Rare though it is, recurrent pericarditis can be the sole manifestation of FMF [Okutur et al 2008]. \n\u2022 Amyloidosis. Type AA amyloidosis is common in untreated individuals, especially in Jews of North African origin. It presents with persistent, heavy proteinuria leading to nephrotic syndrome and progressive nephropathy leading to end-stage kidney disease. Afected individuals who are otherwise asymptomatic can develop renal amyloidosis as the frst and only manifestation of FMF type 2. With increased longevity of individuals with kidney failure through dialysis and/or kidney transplantation, amyloid deposits are being found in other organs as well. Te prevalence of amyloidosis varies by ethnicity, genotype, and sex. In untreated individuals, amyloidosis can occur in $60\\%$ of individuals of Turkish descent and in up to $75\\%$ of North African Jews [Livneh et al 1999, Shohat et al 1999]. \nTe age of onset of FMF attacks appears to be earlier in persons with amyloidosis than in those without amyloidosis.",

PAU can occur in younger patients but often in the setting of a connective tissue disorder, and men are more commonly affected than women.8The natural history of PAU is not well defined, as they can remain stable, enlarge, or progress to either IMH, dissection, pseudoaneurysm, or aortic rupture.",
