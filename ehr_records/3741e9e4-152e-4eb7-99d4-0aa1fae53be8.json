  "reasoning": "The patient, Jorge Thomas, presented with chest pain.  While the provided medical record is extremely sparse, lacking a physical exam, assessment, and plan, the chest pain, in conjunction with the available medical literature, necessitates further investigation. The literature highlights the importance of considering aortic dissection in patients with chest pain, especially those with a potential genetic predisposition like Marfan syndrome.  The chest scan analysis failed, indicating the need for a more reliable imaging modality such as a CT scan or echocardiogram (TTE/TEE) as recommended in the literature for evaluating mediastinal structures and the aorta. The literature emphasizes that the choice of imaging should be based on clinical presentation and availability, and that echocardiography is a viable alternative if CT is contraindicated.  Given the lack of information and the severity of potential underlying conditions, genetic testing for Marfan syndrome is recommended to assess for a genetic predisposition to aortic dissection or other cardiovascular issues.  The literature explicitly states that there is no single test to diagnose Marfan syndrome, but a clinical evaluation including genetic testing is crucial.  The family history is missing, which is a key component in the diagnosis of Marfan syndrome.  Therefore, genetic testing should be part of a comprehensive evaluation.",

      "contents": " Use of electrocardiographic-synchronized CT techniques should be considered when there is a need to accurately depict mediastinal structures (eg, proximal aorta, coronary ostia). When IMH is present, the extent and thickness of the hematoma can be documented and, when PAUs are present, the presence of and size of pseudoaneurysms can be easily defined. \n\n2. In general, the choice of the initial imaging modality should be based on the patient\u2019s history and clinical presentation, the specific clinical questions to be answered, and the institutional availability, experience, and expertise with each of the diagnostic imaging techniques.6 In certain clinical circumstances, for example, patients with a history of an iodinated contrast reaction or patients who are too unstable to travel to the radiology suite, CT may not be preferred. Echocardiography (TEE/ TTE) is an alternative. TTE is noninvasive, can be performed at the bedside, and may be helpful in eliciting the diagnosis of AAS and quickly identifying complications of AAS, such as AR or pericardial effusion and tamponade. TEE is preferred to TTE, however, because of its higher sensitivity and better anatomic resolution; TEE can be performed at the bedside in the emergency department or, alternatively, once the patient is in the operating room. MRI is most commonly the third-choice modality, given that it is not readily available, requires skilled interpretation, and has longer acquisition times, as well as the fact it is challenging to provide clinical care to potentially unstable patients while in an MRI scanner. Consequently, MRI is most often used as a follow-up imaging modality in patients in which there is diagnostic uncertainty. Nevertheless, MRI may be the study of choice in the acute setting for a stable patient with a contraindication to iodinated contrast. \n\n7.3. Medical Management of AAS \nSynopsis \nPatients presenting with AAS need to be treated promptly to prevent acute and chronic complications. In all patients with AAS, immediate medical therapy is indicated while considering urgent surgical (in patients with type A aortic dissection), endovascular intervention (in patients with type B aortic dissection), or both; medical therapy includes aggressive heart rate and BP management as well as pain control.",

IF YOU SUSPECT MARFAN SYNDROME \nIf you suspect that you or a family member may have Marfan syndrome, find a doctor who is knowledgeable about the condition. Ideally, the diagnostic process should be coordinated by a medical geneticist (a doctor who specializes in genetic conditions such as Marfan syndrome). A second choice is a cardiologist (heart doctor). Make sure the cardiologist has treated people who have Marfan syndrome.

For disorders in which a mutation or change in one copy of a gene is sufficient to produce a clinical condition, the resulting disorder is referred to as a dominant disorder. Marfan syndrome is a dominant disorder in which one copy of the FBN1 gene has a mutation that affects the function of the protein, fibrillin-1, produced under the direction of the gene. In the situation in which one parent has the disorder, the altered copy of the gene can be inherited from an affected parent. Each child of an affected individual has a $50\\%$ chance to inherit the mutated copy and develop Marfan syndrome. If they inherit the normal copy from their affected parent, then they are not at risk to develop Marfan syndrome and, equally important, cannot pass that altered copy to their own children.",

Pectus Deformities \nDepression of the breast bone (pectus excavatum) can reduce the space available for the lungs somewhat. This is usually not a problem unless the person also has severe scoliosis and lordosis of the upper spine. A pectus excavatum also interferes with the mechanics of expanding the lungs. The primary symptom is shortness of breath during exercise. A protrusion of the breast bone (pectus carinatum) has little effect on lung volumes or function. \nii. Pneumothorax \nOne possible effect of a mutation in fibrillin-1 is pneumothorax, in which air escapes the lung into the space between the lung and the inner lining of the chest. The symptoms of this are shortness of breath, a dry cough, and often sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain (pain that gets worse when you take a deep breath). The pain may be confused with an aortic dissection or heart attack, and should always prompt evaluation in an emergency room. A pneumothorax is most common in people who have a \u2018bleb\u2019 or bubble of lung tissue, typically at the top of the lungs. \n\niii. Emphysema \nEmphysema is a condition in which the walls of the tiny air sacs in the lungs are damaged so they cannot push all the used air out of the lungs. Approximately $10{-}15\\%$ of people with Marfan syndrome have emphysema, but it may be underdiagnosed. Symptoms include shortness of breath during activity, frequent bronchitis (often as a result of common colds or viruses settling in the chest) and low blood oxygen. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a chest x-ray, CT scan, pulmonary function test or arterial blood test. \niv. Asthma \nAsthma, which is very common in the general population, is also present in the Marfan community. People with Marfan syndrome who have asthma should see a respiratory specialist who can coordinate care with other specialists because the conventional treatments for asthma\u2014beta-agonists\u2014have the opposite effect of beta-blockers (which are prescribed to many people with Marfan syndrome). \nv.

However, children with Marfan syndrome should be checked for scoliosis by their pediatricians even before fifth grade, then at each annual physical exam. This is done by having the child bend forward while the back is examined by a doctor or nurse. If a child does not show signs of scoliosis by the start of middle school, he or she probably will not develop it later to a significant degree. Scoliosis rarely begins in adulthood. \nThe term progression refers to scoliosis becoming more severe. The chance of a curve progressing, or worsening, depends on how much growth a person has left and the size of the current curve. Curves are measured by the angle between the vertebrae (as seen on the x-ray on the following page), given as a number or degrees (\u00ba). A small curve (less than 20\u00ba) in an adolescent has a low chance of worsening. A moderate curve (20\u00ba\u201340\u00ba) has a greater chance of worsening in a child or adolescent. A large curve (more than $40^{\\mathrm{o}}$ ) almost certainly will progress, in either a child or an adult. This is because there is already so much imbalance in the spine that gravity will continue to worsen it. \nMost children are checked for scoliosis in fifth grade; children with Marfan syndrome should be checked earlier and again each year. \nTreatment is sometimes recommended because scoliosis can cause many problems, including back pain, decreased lung function, and posture and shape disturbances. A child with scoliosis should have his or her back checked one or two times per year. An adult with scoliosis should have it examined every one to three years. If the curve is increasing and is more than $20^{\\mathrm{o}}$ , some treatment is usually recommended in growing children and adolescents because exercise alone will not prevent a curve from progressing.

Ultrasound imaging has been the standard for surveillance imaging of the abdominal aorta and is widely used.

People with Marfan syndrome have a $50\\%$ chance of passing the mutation on each time they have a child. \nPeople are born with Marfan syndrome but may not notice any features until later in life. Marfan syndrome features can appear at any age, including in infants and young children. They often get worse as people age. \n3. WHAT IS THE PROGNOSIS FOR PEOPLE WITH MARFAN SYNDROME? \nThere is no cure for Marfan syndrome, but with early diagnosis, proper treatment and careful management of the disorder, it is possible for people to live a normal life span. The outlook today for people with Marfan syndrome is far brighter than it was a few decades ago. In the days before open-heart surgery, the average life expectancy was reduced by a third. Now, early diagnosis and careful management have greatly improved the prognosis and increased life expectancy. Medical and surgical treatments continue to improve and offer hope to even the most severely affected infants, children and adults. In addition, proper management can relieve or prevent many of the complications that interfere with daily activities. \n1.HOW IS MARFAN SYNDROME DIAGNOSED? \nAlthough scientists have determined that Marfan syndrome is caused by a variation in the fibrillin-1 gene on chromosome 15, there is no simple test that can conclusively diagnose Marfan syndrome. Therefore, diagnosis is made primarily through a clinical evaluation. Genetic testing may be helpful in some situations (see page 22). \nBecause most features of Marfan syndrome progress with age, the diagnosis is often more obvious in teens or adults. But children, even newborns, can and should be examined. For these reasons, the diagnostic evaluation should be performed by physicians experienced with the condition. The evaluation should include: \nA detailed medical and family history.   \nA complete physical examination.   \nA thorough eye examination by an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) using a slit lamp to look for lens dislocation after fully dilating the pupil.   \nAn electrocardiogram (EKG) and an echocardiogram to look for involvement of the cardiovascular system that may be not evident from the physical examination. \n",

Tumors \nTumors of the thoracic aorta are usually secondary, resulting from contiguous or metastatic spread of primary malignancies, especially lung and esophageal.1,2 Primary malignant tumors of the aorta, which are extremely rare, are most often primary sarcomas that protrude into the lumen but leave the aortic wall intact. Aortic sarcomas are aggressive tumors with a propensity for arterial embolization, disseminated metastases, and rapid clinical deterioration,3,4 usually with limited survival after initial diagnosis.5,6 Tumors of the thoracoabdominal aorta may exhibit nonspecific symptoms. On imaging, aortic tumors are often initially mistaken for atherosclerosis or aneurysmal disease7 (although PET imaging may suggest tumor metabolic activity over metabolically quiescent atherosclerosis), so the diagnosis is often made by histologic examination of embolic debris or surgical specimens8-10; in some cases, the diagnosis is made postmortem. Combined therapy with surgery (resection and reconstruction of the segment of aorta containing the neoplasm) and chemoradiotherapy provide the best survival results, although the overall prognosis remains poor. \n10. PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND QUALITY OF LIFE \nSynopsis \nAs surgical outcomes for aortic disease improve, a focus on patient-reported health-related quality of life (HRQOL) outcomes is becoming increasingly important,10 because patients have become increasingly concerned about HRQOL issues such as returning to work, pain management, risk of infection, activity recommendations and restrictions, and neurologic complications.",

Other symptoms that warrant expedited, although not necessarily urgent AAA repair, include tenderness to palpation overlying the AAA in the abdomen, back, or flank, embolism (eg, blue toe syndrome) or compressive symptoms (eg, obstructive uropathy). Observational studies show that patients treated for symptomatic aneurysms have higher mortality and morbidity rates than those treated electively.7,8 Although timing of repair of symptomatic aneurysms remains controversial, most studies have reported outcomes of symptomatic aneurysms repaired during a patient\u2019s index operation, with some studies finding that performing surgery on a nonemergency basis and potentially optimizing patient\u2019s cardiorespiratory status during their hospitalization may be advantageous.8,13-15 \n3. Saccular AAAs are rare and, consequently, there are limited natural history data.
