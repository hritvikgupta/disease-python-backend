Other processes that may be associated with ST elevation include hyperkalemia, pulmonary embolism, and Brugada syndrome. The clinical setting and specific electrocardiographic criteria often allow identification of the cause.

These changes include widening of the QRS duration, an increase in the QRS amplitude and secondary changes in the ST segment and T waves. Typically, there is ST segment depression and T wave inversion (or biphasic T waves) in the lateral leads and ST segment elevation (STE) in the precordial leads V1-V3. However, other patterns of ST-T changes may occur. These changes may vary over time and may not necessarily reflect acute ischemia. The ST-T changes secondary to LVH interfere with ECG interpretation and may affect our accuracy in diagnosing STEMI and other forms of active ischemia. The current guidelines specify thresholds for STE in patients without LVH for whom acute reperfusion therapy is indicated; however, there are no such thresholds for patients with LVH.\n\nSource: PubMed (PMID: 24997779)",

Fascicular Blocks: Update 2019\n\n### Title: Fascicular Blocks: Update 2019\n### Authors: Not specified in the search results\n### Journal: Not specified in the search results\n### Year: 2019\n\nThis review aims to redefine reliable criteria for the electrocardiographic and vectorcardiographic diagnosis of left fascicular blocks, also known as hemiblocks. The concept of hemiblocks was significantly advanced by the Argentinian School of Electrocardiology, which helped bridge gaps in understanding electrocardiograms that were previously unexplained. The review discusses the anatomy of the left bundle branch and its clinical significance, including the incidence and prevalence of left anterior and left posterior hemiblocks, both isolated and associated with right bundle branch block (RBBB).\n\nThe trifascicular nature of the intraventricular conduction system is supported by clinical and experimental observations. The presence of RBBB facilitates the interpretation of these blocks by showing how impulses can follow different pathways within the left ventricle. When the impulse follows the posterior division (due to an anterior block), the axis of the QRS complex shifts superiorly to the left. Conversely, when the impulse follows the anterior division (due to a posterior block), the axis shifts inferiorly to the right.\n\nThe review highlights that left anterior hemiblock (LAH) alone or associated with RBBB is common in conditions like coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies, and certain degenerative diseases. Experimental studies in animals have supported the concept of hemiblocks by demonstrating \"divisional\" left bundle branch block and \"trifascicular\" heart block. These findings have implications for understanding various pathophysiological and electrocardiographic phenomena, including the mechanism of bidirectional tachycardia and the site of origin of ventricular ectopic beats.\n\nThe most reliable evidence for diagnosing hemiblocks comes from experimental approaches, clinical cases with intermittent conduction disturbances in the left bundle branch divisions, and aberrant ventricular conduction of premature supraventricular beats.",

Patients commonly present with chest pain, ST segment elevation, prolonged QT interval and slight elevation of cardiac enzymes and biomarker levels, despite the absence of significant coronary artery disease. Because of the peculiar left ventricular apical ballooning shape, given by characteristic regional wall motion abnormalities consisting in apical akinesis and basal hyperkinesis, this syndrome was named \"Takotsubo\" cardiomyopathy, after a round Japanese octopus fishing pot. An episode of emotional or physical stress, including a number of noncardiac illnesses, can be often identified as a trigger. Its unique features include also a strong female predominance and a complete rapid resolution. The management of this syndrome consists mainly in supportive and symptomatic therapy. The evolution, although mainly uneventful, can be complicated, rarely, by left ventricular rupture, making thus the takotsubo cardiomyopathy a newly recognized cause of sudden death. We present some data on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical picture and management of this peculiar form of heart disease, which, although easily confounded with an acute coronary syndrome, has emerged as a unique nosologic entity.",
