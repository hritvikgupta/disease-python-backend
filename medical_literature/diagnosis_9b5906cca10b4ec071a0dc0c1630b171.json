E-mail:bebiondi@unina.it.\n\nReceived 2018 Jun 30; Accepted 2018 Oct 15; Collection date 2019 Jun.\n\nThyroid dysfunction and diabetes mellitus are closely linked. Several studies have documented the increased prevalence of thyroid disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus andvice versa. This review critically discusses the different underlying mechanisms linking type 1 and 2 diabetes and thyroid dysfunction to demonstrate that the association of these two common disorders is unlikely a simple coincidence. We assess the current state of knowledge on the central and peripheral control of thyroid hormone on food intake and glucose and lipid metabolism in target tissues (such as liver, white and brown adipose tissue, pancreatic\u03b2cells, and skeletal muscle) to explain the mechanism linking overt and subclinical hypothyroidism to type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. We also elucidate the common susceptibility genes and the pathogenetic mechanisms contributing to the autoimmune mechanism involved in the onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune thyroid disorders. An untreated thyroid dysfunction can impair the metabolic control of diabetic patients, and this association can have important repercussions on the outcome of both of these disorders. Therefore, we offer recommendations for the diagnosis, management, and screening of thyroid disorders in patients with diabetes mellitus, including the treatment of diabetic patients planning a pregnancy. We also discuss the major causes of failure to achieve an optimal management of thyroid dysfunction in diabetic patients and provide recommendations for assessing and treating these disorders during therapy with antidiabetic drugs. An algorithm for a correct approach of these disorders when linked is also provided.\n\nAutoimmune thyroid dysfucntion occurs in 17% to 30% of adults with type 1 diabetes\n\nThyroid dysfunction is more common in patients with type 2 diabetes than in the general population\n\nPreexisting diabetes mellitus is exacerbated by hyperthyroidism\n\nInsulin treatment should be adjusted in patients with diabetes after the occurrence of thyroid dysfunction\n\nHyperglycemia should be reevaluated in hyperthyroid subjects after the control of thyroid dysfunction\n\nLiraglutide is not recommended in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid cancer or type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia\n\nPioglitazone should not be administered to diabetic patients with clinically active Graves ophthalmopathy\n\nThyroid dysfunction (TD) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are two of the most frequent chronic endocrine disorders with variable prevalence among different populations.\n\nThe prevalence of TD in Europe and the United States is \u223c6.6% in adults (1\u20133); it increases with age and is higher in women than in men. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can develop in severe or subclinical forms (4). T3, the active thyroid hormone (TH), exerts a negative feedback at the level of both thyrotrophs in the pituitary and tanycytes in the hypothalamus; it induces a reduction in TRH, as well as TSH secretion in response to adequate tissue levels of TH. Therefore, subclinical thyroid disorders (STDs) are characterized by low or increased serum TSH with TH levels at the upper and lower limits of their reference range, respectively, in subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHyper) and subclinical hypothyroidism (SHypo) (4,5). STDs are more frequent than overt diseases; they can be asymptomatic and, therefore, undiagnosed and untreated, leading to important adverse events (4,5).\n\nDM is also a frequent condition in the general population. The global prevalence of this disorder has nearly doubled since 1980, rising from 4.7% to 8.5% in the adult population (6). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III reports that \u223c14% of the adult US population suffers from either DM or an impaired fasting glucose levels (7). Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Diabetes Fact Sheet estimate that DM may be frequently undiagnosed; \u223c35% of the adults >20 years of age and 50% of those >65 years of age in the United States may have prediabetes based on fasting glucose or glycated HbA1c levels (8).\n\nDM and thyroid disease are two closely associated disorders. The NHANES III study reported a higher prevalence of TD in subjects in the United States with diabetes compared with those without diabetes, especially in patients with positive anti-thyroperoxidase (TPO) antibodies (Abs) (3).\n\nThe aim of this review is to describe the effect of THs on glucose metabolism and assess the current state of knowledge on type 1 and 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D) and coexisting TD, the prevalence of these two associated diseases, and the underlying mechanisms linking these conditions. Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can impair the metabolic control in patients with diabetes. For this reason, we will discuss the consequences of TD in patients with diabetes and the prognostic implications of these associated comorbidities. Current evidence suggests the necessity of treating TD in patients with DM to improve their prognosis. Therefore, we will offer recommendations for the management of TD in patients with both subclinical and overt thyroid disorders and DM, including the treatment of patients with diabetes who are planning a pregnancy and during pregnancy. To aid clinicians in daily practice, we will provide an algorithm for the evaluation and treatment of TD and DM examined from a global viewpoint. Finally, given the relatively high prevalence of both TD and DM and the serious nature of their prognosis, especially when correlated, we will discuss the need to screen the onset of thyroid disease in patients with diabetes. To this point, we will talk about the controversies regarding the screening program among different guidelines\n\nWe searched for personal files, MEDLINE articles, meta-analyses, and references of relevant articles and textbooks published from 1977 to 2018, as well as citations from recently published international guidelines.\n\nThe following search terms were used: thyroxine, triiodothyronine, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, subclinical thyroid disease, type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, gestational diabetes, prevalence, incidence, deiodinases, glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, adipose tissue, appetite regulation, skeletal muscle, screening, morbidity, and mortality.\n\nA critical assessment of the literature was performed. The authors agreed on the criteria for the inclusion or exclusion of the studies considered. Preference was given to high-quality papers, meta-analyses, randomized controlled and longitudinal trials, and studies performed with correct statistical analysis and accurate methods. When identified, limitations in the study design or execution were also discussed.\n\nT1D is due to autoimmune\u03b2cell destruction, usually leading to absolute insulin deficiency. This disorder is closely associated with autoimmune-induced TD in clinical practice because these endocrine diseases are linked by the same pathophysiological mechanism. They share an autoimmune predisposition, and some genetic factors might contribute to the co-occurrence of autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) and T1D (9,10). An increased risk for thyroid autoimmunity has been reported in adults with T1D and late-onset autoimmune-induced diabetes (10\u201313).\n\nAITD occurs in 17% to 30% of adults with T1D; these patients are at an increased risk of both autoimmune-induced hypothyroidism [Hashimoto thyroiditis, (HT)] as well as hyperthyroidism [Graves disease (GD)] (10\u201313). T1D patients develop TD at an early age compared with the general population, and therefore autoimmune hypothyroidism is present in 25% of children with T1D (14,15). Its onset is associated with a more aggressive presentation of TD and poorly controlled diabetes in pediatric patients with T1D (14,15) [seeTable 1(10\u201315)].\n\nPrevalence of TD in T1D\n\nFrom Eisenbarth and Gottlieb (10); Shunet al.(11); Jinet al.(12); Gambelungheet al.(13); Libmanet al.(14); and Fatourechiet al.(15).\n\nAccording to the results of the HUNT study, a population-based study in Nord-Tr\u00f8ndelag, Norway, adult women with T1D have about a twofold higher risk of having hypothyroidism, whereas men with T1D have an approximate fourfold higher risk for developing hypothyroidism, with an increased prevalence in patients with positive TPO Abs (16). Patients with T1D and TPO Ab positivity are 18-fold more likely to develop hypothyroidism compared with type 1 patients with diabetes with TPO negativity during a period of 18 years (17). The onset of TD is frequently associated with duration of diabetes (18).\n\nThe association of AITD and T1D as two autoimmune-induced endocrine disorders is denominated as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 variant (APS3). T1D and AITD may also coexist within both the very rare juvenile APS type 1 (encompassing autoimmune hypoparathyroidism and primary hypogonadism) as well as within the APS adult type 2 with Addison disease as the primary endocrine component. However, both in APS1 and APS2, AITD and T1D neither define the diagnosis nor are they the major endocrine components (19,20). The prevalence of APS3 is \u223c1:20,000 (19). It occurs more frequently in women. The male-to-female ratio is 1:3. The incidence of APS3 peaks at ages 20 to 60 years, mostly in the third or fourth decade (20). AITD peaks in the fourth decade for GD or fifth and sixth decade for HT. The simultaneous occurrence of autoimmune-induced hypothyroidism and T1D leads often to hypoglycemia due to decreased insulin requirement and increased insulin sensitivity. Glucose intolerance accompanies autoimmune hyperthyroidism in 50% of patients. In APS3, circulating organ-specific Abs are present in each of the component diseases. Occasionally, Abs will cross-react with more than one gland. Abs usually precede clinical disease; however, in contrast to anti-islet Abs, anti-thyroid Abs can be present for decades without progression to overt disease. Current diagnosis of APS3 involves serological measurement of organ-specific Abs and subsequent functional testing, that is, baseline TSH, FSH, LH, free T4, testosterone, estradiol, fasting morning glucose, and cortisol, an ACTH stimulation test (when adrenal Abs are present), as well as serum Na+, K+, Ca, and blood cell count (19). Management of patients with APS, including their family relatives, is recommended in centers with special expertise in autoimmune endocrine disorders.\n\nAPS3 is a genetically complex and multifactorial syndrome (21). Several genetic loci possibly interact with environmental factors. APS3 is characterized by a complex inheritance pattern. Family and population studies showed that APS3 has a strong genetic background. Whole-genome and candidate gene approaches identified several gene variations, which are present in both T1D and AITD. For APS3, disease susceptibility genes are human leukocyte antigen (HLA) on chromosome 6, protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22 (PTPN22) on chromosome 1, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA) on chromosome 2, forkhead box P3 (FOXP3) on the X chromosome, and IL-2 receptor\u03b1(IL-2R\u03b1) gene region on chromosome 10 (22). These genes are involved in the immune regulation and T cell activation within the immunological synapse (Table 2). Further candidate genes with joint risk for AITD and T1D are the v-erb-b2 erythroblast leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3 (ERBB3) gene on chromosome 12, C-type lectin domain family 16 member A (CLEC16A) on chromosome 16 (involved in pathogen recognition), the proinflammatory cytokineTNF-\u03b1gene, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I chain-related gene A (MICA), theVNTR(insulin) gene, and theCD40gene. Thus, T1D and AITD share common susceptibility gene variants, which possibly act pleiotropically as risk factors for the development of autoimmunity in APS3.\n\nJoint Susceptibility Genes for T1D and AITD\n\nAbbreviations: CD40, B cell\u2013associated molecule CD40; CLEC16A, C-type lectin domain family 16 member A; ERBB3, v-erb-b2 erythroblast leukemia viral oncogene homolog 3; IL-1RA, IL-1 receptor antagonist; IL2RA, IL-2R\u03b1; MICA, MHC class I chain-related gene A; NK, natural killer; NKG2, NK cell group 2 (group of genes that are expressed primarily in NK cells encoding a family of C-type lectins; the NKG2D gene is expressed as a major 1.8-kb and a minor 3.2-kb transcript in NK cell lines and in some T cell lines); Tg, thyroglobulin; VNTR (insulin), insulin gene variable number of an 86-tandem repeat [a penta-allelic 86-bp tandem repeat (VNTR) occurs in intron 2, of which allele 2 (IL1RN*2) is associated with autoimmune conditions].\n\nT1D and AITD are both organ-specific T cell\u2013mediated diseases. All four confirmed joint susceptibility genes identified for APS3 are involved in the immunological synapse and T cell activation: theHLA-DRmolecules present autoantigens to T cells,PTPN22negatively influences the T cell receptor signaling pathway,CTLA-4suppresses T cell activation, andFOXP3regulates the differentiation of regulatory T cells (23).\n\nAPS3 is strongly associated with certain alleles of theHLAgenes within the MHC (Table 2).HLAclass II is a potential gene locus for combined susceptibility to T1D and AITD, as has been shown in whites and Asians (24\u201333). The gene products of theHLAclass II genes are involved in immune reactions. The differentHLAclass II alleles are characterized by different affinities for peptides. Therefore, some autoantigenic peptides may be recognized by T lymphocyte receptors, whereas others may not (34). Most family studies gave evidence that the haplotypeHLA-DR3-DQB1*0201 is the primary haplotype conferring susceptibility to both T1D and AITD within families (29). Here, DR3 seems to be the primary allele conferring risk to both T1D and AITD, whereas DQB1*0201 is less relevant. Many population studies indicate that bothHLAhaplotypes DR3-DQB1*0201 and DR4-DQB1*0302 contribute to APS3 (24,35). The HLA-DRB1*03 allele was strongly increased in patients with APS3 (51%) vs both controls [22%,P< 0.0001; relative risk (RR), 2.32; 95% CI, 1.62 to 3.33] and monoglandular autoimmune disease (11%,P< 0.0001). HLA-DRB1*03 was highly prevalent in APS3 patients with early vs late disease onset (P< 0.05). HLA-DRB1*04 allele carriers were more present in APS3 vs controls (53% vs 22%,P< 0.0001; RR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.68 to 3.38). Furthermore, HLA-DQB1*02 was increased in APS3 vs controls (P< 0.01), whereas HLA-DQB1*06 was decreased (P< 0.001). Thus, HLA-DRB1*03 is a stronger genetic marker in APS3, foremost in those with early disease onset (36).\n\nThe differentHLAclass II alleles show different pocket II structures and different affinities for peptides (37). There are two mechanisms by which HLA class II variants could be involved in the common etiology of T1D and AITD. The first mechanism refers to the structure of the HLA pockets, coded by the HLA class II alleles, and the second mechanism refers to the peptide binding (38,39). First, two distinct HLA class II molecules (e.g., DQB1 for T1D and DR3 for AITD) with distinct pocket structures are in tight linkage disequilibrium, and thereby they are inherited together and expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) together. Thus, both islet cell peptides and thyroid-derived peptides will fit in these pockets. Second, two distinct HLA class II molecules share a similar HLA class II pocket structure fitting both islet cell peptides as well as thyroid-derived peptides (40). The common pocket structure could also influence the anchoring of the T cell receptor and not the peptide binding.\n\nThePTPN22gene maps on chromosome one location 1p13 (41). This gene encodes the lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase (LYP) protein. Both immature and mature B and T lymphocytes express LYP, which is a negative regulator of signal transduction through the T cell receptor. LYP inhibits the T lymphocyte antigen receptor signaling pathway (42) and binds to protein kinase Csk, thereby limiting the response to antigens (43). LYP associates with the molecular adaptor protein CBL and may be involved in regulating CBL function in the T cell antigen receptor signaling pathway. It binds to Csk, thereby limiting the response to antigens. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in thePTPN22gene, a 1858 C\u2192T transition, causing a tryptophan for arginine substitution in the LYP protein (R620W), is associated with T1D, AITD, and vitiligo (44\u201348). Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms of the protein. The minor T allele is associated with T1D and AITD (49\u201351). This is involved in altered T lymphocyte activation. In Asian patients, a novel SNP in the promoter region of thePTPN22gene, G1123C, has been associated with T1D and AITD (51). Additional candidate polymorphisms may be also causative (52). In an association study, 310 white subjects with APS3, AITD, or T1D or healthy controls were genotyped for the C1858T polymorphism (53). The PTPN22 1858 minor T allele frequency was strongly increased in patients with APS3 (24%) compared with controls (8.0%,P< 0.001), with patients with AITD only (9%,P< 0.006), or with T1D only (11%,P< 0.028). T allele carriers were also more frequently present in the group with APS3 vs controls (41% vs 14%; OR, 4.35; 95% CI, 2.08 to 9.09), AITD (17%; OR, 3.42; 95% CI, 1.56 to 7.48), and T1D (21%; OR, 2.59; 95% CI, 1.23 to 5.45). Especially in subjects with both HT and T1D, T allele carriers were mostly frequent (50% vs 14%; OR, 6.14; 95% CI, 2.62 to 14.38;P< 0.001). Considering all included patients with AITD, T allele carriers were 29% vs 14.0% in controls (P< 0.008; OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 1.30 to 4.98). Patients carrying the PTPN22 1858 T allele had a twofold increased frequency of the HLA-DRB1*03 allele (65% vs 37%,P< 0.034). Finally, in the first performed genome-wide association study in patients with both T1D and AITD, thePTPN22gene on chromosome 1 was recognized as joint susceptibility locus with a significantly increased log score (54).\n\nTheCTLA-4gene encodes a negative regulator of T cell activation, which is expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes. It is involved in the interaction between T lymphocytes and APCs (55). APCs present to the T lymphocyte receptor an antigenic peptide bound to anHLAclass II protein on the cell surface, thus activating T lymphocytes. Furthermore, costimulatory signals on the APC surface interact with receptors (e.g.,CTLA-4) on the surface of CD4+T lymphocytes during antigen presentation.CTLA-4downregulates T lymphocyte activation (56). A genetic variant that decreases CTLA-4 function and therefore increases T cell activation might promote development of autoimmunity in APS3.CTLA-4polymorphisms are associated with AITD (45). In contrast, findings are inconsistent with respect to the association ofCTLA-4and T1D, suggesting a weak effect (57\u201361). A 3\u2032 untranslated region (AT)nmicrosatellite polymorphism with longer and shorter repeats of AT are related to autoimmunity, whereas longer repeats are associated with decreased inhibitory function ofCTLA-4(62). Longer repeats correlate with a shorter half-life of theCTLA-4mRNA than do shorter repeats (63). TheCTLA-4AT repeat affects the inhibitory function ofCTLA-4in that the long AT repeat allele is associated with a reduced control of T cell proliferation in patients with GD (62). The causativeCTLA-4gene polymorphism for autoimmunity may be located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region of theCTLA-4gene.CTLA-4CT60, anotherCTLA-4gene polymorphism, was analyzed in patients with APS3, AITD, T1D, and in healthy controls (53). The CT60 G/G genotype was significantly more common in patients with APS3 than in healthy controls (49% vs 32%; OR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.07 to 3.77;P= 0.038). The CT60 allele frequencies differed as well between APS3 patients and controls, with the predisposing G allele being increased in APS3 (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.55;P= 0.042). Patients with APS3 did not differ from those with AITD or T1D. Another A/G49 SNP results in a threonine-to-alanine substitution in the signal peptide of the CTLA-4 protein. This leads to a less efficient glycosylation in the endoplasmic reticulum and reduced surface expression of the CTLA-4 protein (64), which negatively affects CTLA-4 function or expression, resulting in increased T cell activation.\n\nTheFOXP3gene modulates the differentiation of regulatory T cells (65). A reduced function, due to genetic variants, could promote the development of autoimmunity in APS3. Both a haplotype consisting of allele 10 of a microsatellite and the T allele of a C/T SNP were related with APS3 (40). Because the microsatellite is located past the zinc finger domain of theFOXP3gene, it could affect downstream splicing, thereby impeding the function of the gene.\n\nTheIL-2R\u03b1/CD25gene impacts production and function of regulatory T cells actively suppressing autoreactive T cells in the periphery (66). Polymorphisms in theCD25gene region might affect the function of regulatory T cells, and thereby could influence the development of the autoimmune diseases T1D and AITD (67). TheCLEC16Agene contains a C-type lectin domain, and the encoded protein is detected in immune cells (68). It is implicated in pathogen recognition and might predispose for immune-mediated diseases.\n\nThe proinflammatory cytokineTNF\u03b1gene is located within the class III region of the MHC betweenHLA-Bloci of class I andHLA-Dloci of class II. It encodes the proinflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1. The uncommon A allele of the TNF\u03b1\u2212308 SNP is associated with increased transcription and production of the TNF\u03b1protein, which has been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases (69,70). The putative association between a polymorphism of theTNF\u03b1\u2212308and APS3 was analyzed (71). TheTNF\u03b1 \u2212308*Aallele occurred more frequently in patients (0.27) than in controls (0.16,P= 0.008). Also,TNF\u03b1 \u2212308*Acarriers were more frequent in patients than controls (48% vs 31%; OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.19 to 3.00). The frequency of the AA genotype was increased in APS3 (P= 0.014). APS3 patients with AITD and theTNF\u03b1 \u2212308 AAgenotype showed the highest prevalence of thyroid autoantibodies. Finally, HLA-DRB1*03 andTNF\u03b1 \u2212308*Aalleles were strongly associated in patients with APS3 (88%,P< 0.00001). Collectively, these findings indicate similar immunogenetics of T1D and AITD.\n\nDM has been reported in mitochondrial diseases caused by autosomal recessive mutations in the nuclear genesPOLG,RRM2B,OPA1, andMPV17(72). Mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to type 1 or type 2 DM. The average age of onset of this disorder is 38 years for the common m.3243A>G mutation, and 40 to 56 years for other mutations. Individuals with m.3243A>G and DM have combined insulin deficiency and insulin resistance and a high risk of progression of their dysfunction. Genetic mitochondrial disease should be suspected in patients with endocrine dysfunction (DM, ovarian failure, adrenal insufficiency, and hypoparathyroidism) and associated with multisystem disease. However, tyroid dysfunction has been infrequently reported in mitochondrial disease. A polyendocrinopathy including DM, adrenal insufficiency, and hypothyroidism was reported in twins with a heterozygousPOLGmutation p.G517V27 (72).\n\nMaturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a monogenic form of DM characterized by autosomal dominant inheritance and early age of onset (<25 years) (73). Mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1\u03b1or HNF-1\u03b2genes are responsible for MODY type 3 and MODY type 5, respectively (73). Interestingly, HNF-1\u03b1may also influence carcinogenesis. HNF-1\u03b2is expressed in papillary cancer cell lines with high human nicotinamideN-methyltransferase gene expression (74). It is not expressed in other papillary, follicular, and H\u00fcrthle cancer cell lines and in primary cultures of normal thyroid cells and benign thyroid conditions. Moreover, both HNF-1\u03b1mRNA and protein have been detected in anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines, suggesting a potential role of HNF-1\u03b1in more aggressive forms of thyroid cancer (75). Further studies on the function of HNF-1\u03b1and HNF-1\u03b2in thyroid cancer cells should be performed to individualize molecular targeted therapy in the future.\n\nT2D is due to a progressive loss of\u03b2cell insulin secretion commonly on the background of insulin resistance (76). In 2013 it was estimated that \u223c382 million people had DM, of whom 90% to 95% had T2D (76). According to the World Health Organization, the prevalence of DM is expected to increase to 592 million by 2035, developing in \u223c7.8% to 8.8% of adults (77) with an epidemic risk of T2D in populations such as China, Oceania, South and Central Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East (78\u201380). This increasing prevalence of T2D worldwide is probably due to unhealthy lifestyles and the increasing aging population. Insulin resistance, defined as the inability of insulin to increase glucose uptake and utilization in peripheral tissues (muscle, adipose tissue and liver), is a very early event in the pathogenesis of T2D, inducing\u03b2cell dysfunction (81,82). Insulin resistance and the underlying metabolic abnormalities (overnutrition, obesity, and poor physical exercise and inactivity) can be present for years before the onset of hyperglycemia and the clinical diagnosis of T2D. During its early stages,\u03b2cells compensate for insulin resistance by increasing insulin secretion to ensure an appropriate glucose uptake and metabolism in peripheral tissues. However,\u03b2cells are unable to support persistent hyperinsulinemia and, subsequently, postprandial hyperglycemia can develop with the onset of overt T2D in adults. Insulin resistance can occur as part of a cluster of cardiovascular and metabolic abnormalities commonly identified as metabolic syndrome (MetS) (83). This disorder is recognized as an independent risk factor for T2D and cardiovascular disease (CVD), leading to the development of hypertension and accelerated atherosclerosis or polycystic ovarian syndrome, in relationship to the age of the patients and the genetic background (84,85). TD is more common in patients with T2D than in the general population and can adversely influence the metabolic control. Goiter has been recognized as a risk factor for TD in patients with DM, as observed in nondiabetics (86), and parity is a risk factor for TD in women with diabetes (87). The overall prevalence of TD in patients with DM in studies from Europe and Saudi Arabia ranges from 4% to 20% (80,88).\n\nA few studies have prospectively investigated the relationship between TD and the incidence of diabetes (89\u201391). Two Danish register-based studies have reported conflicting results (89,91). A nationwide registry study reported an increased risk of DM in individuals with hyperthyroidism (89), whereas two other studies reported an increased risk of DM in patients with hypothyroidism (90,91).\n\nThe prevalence of hyperthyroidism in patients with diabetes is higher than in the general population (92); it was found in 4.4% of adult patients with T2D (92), while SHyper was present in \u223c2% to 4% of T2 patients with diabetes (93,94). New diagnosis of SHyper in patients with T2D was higher in females than in males (4.3% vs 3.5%), and the relative risk was significantly increased in females only (94). Advanced age and the presence of goiter are significantly and independently correlated with the presence of SHyper in the population with diabetes, suggesting that toxic multinodular goiter is a more frequent cause of hyperthyroidism than GD (95). The presence of T2D does not predict the incidence of hyperthyroidism in the elderly population with diabetes (96).\n\nTH deficiency is unlikely to be a coincidence in patients with T2D because the prevalence of hypothyroidism is higher in patients with diabetes than in the general population. Subclinical and overt hypothyroidism are the most common form of TD in T2D and MetS (97,98). The prevalence of hypothyroidism in T2D ranges from 6% to 20% in epidemiologic studies across different ethnic groups (Table 3) (99\u2013104). This wide range could reflect differences in age, sex, and iodine intake in the populations surveyed. Female sex, older age, obesity, TPO Ab positivity, and hospitalization are associated with an increased risk of developing hypothyroidism in T2D (97,99\u2013102). A significant increased risk of hypothyroidism was observed in patients with T2D >65 years of age with an OR of 4.2 and a clear difference between males and females (OR, 4.82 vs 2.60), patients with obesity and without obesity (OR, 2.56 vs 3.11), and presence or absence of thyroid autoantibodies (OR, 4.26 vs 2.93) (100).\n\nPrevalence of TD in T2D\n\nFrom Al-Geffariet al.(99); Songet al.(100); D\u00edez amd Iglesias (101); Chenet al.(102); Hanet al.(103); and Grayet al.(104).\n\nPooled prevalence from Grayet al.(104).\n\nA large longitudinal study from Australia in women with T2D reported that SHypo is a common finding in T2D (97). It was the prevalent form of TH deficiency in females with diabetes (103,104) and patients with positive TPO Abs (96,100\u2013102). In line with these results, a meta-analysis on 36 articles confirmed a higher pooled prevalence of SHypo in patients with T2D when compared with healthy controls (1.93-fold increased risk; 95% CI, 1.66 to 2.24) (103). It was associated with an increased risk of diabetic microvascular complications (104).\n\nSerum TSH was positively associated with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in euthyroid subjects in several studies (105\u2013107). TSH may directly affect metabolic parameters and stimulate leptin secretion in human adipose tissue (108\u2013111). It exerts an important role in hepatic glucose metabolism with stimulative effects on hepatic glucose productionin vivoandin vitro(112,113). TSH increases the expression of glucose 6-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) at the mRNA level in a mouse liver (112,113). Moreover, TSH reduces insulin secretion and its synthesis from pancreatic\u03b2cells and consequently increases serum blood glucose levels (108\u2013110). Leptin is an important neuroendocrine regulator of the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid (HPT) axis; it acts directly by regulating TRH gene expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and indirectly by regulating TRH via effects in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) (108\u2013115) (Fig. 1). Leptin levels correlate with TSH levels and are elevated in patients with hypothyroidism (108\u2013110). Moreover, leptin levels are elevated in many patients with diabetes and might stimulate the synthesis of TSH by affecting the HPT axis via Janus activating kinase (JAK)-2/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)3 factor (114,115).\n\nCentral and peripheral regulation of TH on food intake, glucose and lipid metabolism in target organs such as liver, white and brown adipose tissue, pancreatic\u03b2cells, and skeletal muscle. AgRP, agouti-related protein; BDNF, brain-derived neurotrophic factor; CART, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript; D2, deiodinase type 2; NE, norepinephrine; NPY, neuropeptide Y; POMC, proopiomelanocortin; PP, pancreatic polypeptide; SNS, sympathetic nervous system;\u03b1-MSH,\u03b1-melanocyte\u2013stimulating hormone;\u03b2-r,\u03b2-receptor.\n\nSome prospective studies have investigated whether changes in serum TSH and/or THs were associated with the risk for developing T2DM. In a large longitudinal study on a euthyroid population without diabetes, Junet al.(116) assessed the association between consecutive changes in serum TSH from the baseline values and the incidence of T2D during a 6-year follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models showed that the risk of incident T2D was significantly increased with each 1 mU/L increment of serum TSH; in particular, this risk was increased in subjects with the highest TSH change tertile compared with the lowest tertile (hazard ratio, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.48;Pfor trend = 0.011). Changes in serum TSH correlated with changes in gylcated hemoglobin (HbA1c), which represents the main indicator of the average glycemic control during 2 to 3 months (116). The same group of authors reported that individual changes in TSH and THs, even within the normal reference range, were an additional risk factor of incident T2DM during a 7-year longitudinal study on 6235 euthyroid subjects without T2D (117). A progressive increase in TSH with a decrease in T3 and FT4, suggesting the development of a more severe form of hypothyroidism, was independently associated with the risk of developing T2D regardless of sex and thyroid autoimmunity. An increase in TSH from baseline (range, \u20134.1 mU/L to +12.3 mU/L) was associated with a higher risk of T2D (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.14 to 1.40 per SD). An increase in FT4 (range, \u20130.60 to +1.60 ng/dL) or T3 (range, \u201376.5 to +223 ng/dL) was associated with a lower risk of incidence of T2D. T3 directly increases islet\u03b2cell mass pathways (118) and controls insulin secretion (119) and intracellular glucose availability. These results suggest that subtle changes in the levels of serum TSH and THs, even within the physiological range, can induce insulin resistance or diabetes (120,121).\n\nThe Rotterdam Study, a large prospective population-based cohort study, investigated the association of thyroid function with the incidence of T2D and the progression from prediabetes to diabetes (122). Higher TSH levels and lower FT4 levels were associated with an increased risk of diabetes and progression from prediabetes to diabetes. On the contrary, high and high-normal thyroid function was protective against the development of and/or progression to T2D (122).\n\nA recent large cross-sectional study from China has found that decreased FT3, decreased FT3/FT4 ratios, and increased FT4 levels were independently related to a higher prevalence of T2D in both males and females (123). A higher prevalence of T2D had a negative correlation with FT3 and a positive correlation with FT4, even after the adjustment for confounding factors in both males and females. The decreased FT3/FT4 ratio could be considered the indicator of the inhibition of the peripheral deiodinase activity, which can lower the basal metabolic rate and explain the pathogenesis of T2D or could reflect the low T3 syndrome in inadequately controlled patients with diabetes (124,125). In a further study, hypothyroidism increased the risk of developing diabetes (RR, 2.06; 95% CI, 1.42 to 2.99) (90), also showing that the risk of DM was also prominent in statin users with SHypo (90). The RR was 1.94 (95% CI, 1.13 to 3.34) and 1.20 (95% CI, 0.52 to 2.75) in statin users and nonusers, respectively (90). Mitochondrial dysfunction can represent the common mechanism related to both DM and TD that can be aggravated by statins. In fact, hypothyroidism and statins can both induce mitochondrial dysfunction (126\u2013129). Interestingly, in this study, patients with hypothyroidism treated with replacement doses of L-T4 were not at increased risk for DM (90)\n\nThere is an increased risk of progression from subclinical to overt hypothyroidism in patients with T2D, especially in women (104). This progression may be deleterious in patients with T2D because the onset of overt TD may deteriorate glucose control in patients with diabetes. A progression rate of 5% per year from SHypo to overt Hypo was reported in patients with diabetes with positive TPO Abs (104). Both AITD and female sex are risk factors for progression of TD among patients with diabetes. Although the duration of diabetes can be a risk for AITD in children and adolescents with T1D (16), it is not the case in those suffering from T2D (84).\n\nTH exerts profound effects on the regulation of glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. These effects are mediated both throughout the central nervous system and the direct interaction of THs with peripheral target organs such as liver, white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT, respectively), pancreatic\u03b2cells, and skeletal muscle (130) (Fig. 1).\n\nTH receptors (TRs)\u03b11 and\u03b21 are important for normal pancreatic islet development (131). Neonatal\u03b2cells have TH receptors, and their exposure to T3 determines the activation of the transcription factor MAFA, which stimulates\u03b2cell maturation and insulin secretion. Moreover, T3 promotes proliferation of pancreatic islet cells (132). It increases proinsulin mRNA expression (131) and also acts as a mitogenic prosurvival factor for pancreatic\u03b2cells through a mechanism that seems to involve MAPK/ERK activation (133). T3 is a physiological regulator of\u03b2cell function. It controls insulin secretion and glucose uptake, acting differently in the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, which are the main targets of insulin action (130,134). TH has insulin-antagonistic effects in the liver, whereas it acts synergically with insulin in the peripheral tissues. TH increases hepatic glucose output through increased hepatic expression of glucose transporter (GLUT)2 and stimulates the endogenous production of glucose through the increase in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, which is responsible for the decrease of liver sensitivity to insulin (135). Treatment with TH increases alanine transport into hepatocytes and the conversion of alanine into glucose (136). An important effect of T3 is the increase of glucose 6-phosphate mRNA expression and the synthesis of PEPCK (137,138). Hepatic PEPCK mRNA is stimulated 3.5-fold in thyrotoxic rats, and it is resistant to insulin suppression of hepatic glucose production compared with euthyroid rats (139). Other hepatic gluconeogenic enzymes are positively regulated by TH (140).\n\nT3 can also centrally modulate hepatic glucose production and insulin sensitivity by acting on the sympathetic pathway, connecting the paraventricular hypothalamus to the liver (141). T3 administration in hypothalamic PVN increases hepatic glucose production independent of plasma T3, insulin, glucagon, and corticosterone. This effect is abolished by selective hepatic sympathectomy, supporting that T3-sensitive neurons in PVN mediate liver glucose production via sympathetic projections on the liver. TH facilitates the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic effects of epinephrine and glucagon by inducing\u03b22-adrenergic receptor mRNA and repression of inhibitory G protein RNA of the adenylate cyclase cascade (142). T3 further increases the dysregulation of liver glucose and lipid metabolism characteristic of insulin resistance by the induction of lipogenic enzymes (135). Both lipogenesis and lipolysis are stimulated by T3. TH may increase fatty acid uptake in the liver via the regulation of fatty acid transporter proteins and increases in hepatic lipogenesis (143\u2013146). The activation of hepatic lipases and lipophagy has been implicated in the intrahepatic lipolysis induced by T3 (147). The conversion of glucose into fatty acids together with nonsuppressed gluconeogenesis perpetuates the hyperinsulinemic state. Hyperthyroidism and high-fat feeding result in significant impairment of islet function. In contrast, physiological T3 treatment prevents streptozocin-induced islet deterioration and maintains islet structure, size, and consistency (133).\n\nT3 upregulates the expression of genes involved in glucose transport and glycolisis in peripheral tissues (140). In the skeletal muscle, T3 modulates mRNA and protein expression of GLUT4, adenosine monophosphate\u2013activated protein kinase, and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (148). Therefore, T3 increases basal and insulin-stimulated glucose transport in this tissue (149). The transcriptional regulation of the sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum (SERCA1a, SERCA2a) and other important proteins can explain the TH-induced shift to faster contractile function in the muscle and the concomitant increase in both glycolytic and oxidative capacities (150\u2013155). T3 can also act by a nongenomic mechanism because it is able to induce within 30 minutes an increase in insulin-dependent GLUT4-mediated glucose uptake, without interfering with other transporters such as GLUT1 and GLUT3 (156). Adipose tissue can modulate insulin sensitivity of skeletal muscle by the release of adipokines and, alternatively, the skeletal muscle can affect adipose tissue by the production of several myokines (157). Interestingly, both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism can interfere with the normal adipocyte\u2013myocyte crosstalk, thus contributing to the insulin resistance (157). Another T3 target in the skeletal muscle is mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP)3; this effect explains the increased energy expenditure induced by TH excess (158\u2013160).\n\nGlucose intolerance in patients with hyperthyroidism is prevalently due to hepatic insulin resistance because TH excess increases the endogenous glucose production and insulin requirement and reduces hepatic insulin sensitivity (Fig. 2) (134,139). Fasting or postprandial insulin and proinsulin levels are elevated in hyperthyroidism, and free fatty acid concentrations are raised (161,162). Glucose and insulin response is increased after an oral glucose tolerance test in patients with subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism (163). Moreover, hyperthyroidism has been associated with increased degradation of insulin (164). Gluconeogenesis is increased in both subclinical and overt hyperthyroidism when compared with euthyroidism. Moreover\u00b8 TH excess increases\u03b2cell apoptosis, and this effect could be one of the major elements responsible for the deterioration of glucose tolerance in thyrotoxicosis leading to hyperglycemia. Peripheral glucose transport and tissue utilization are increased in hyperthyroidism with peripheral insulin resistance (162,163). The insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation rate is increased in the muscle and adipose tissue of patients with hyperthyroidism. The considerable increase of glucose in peripheral tissues leads to an increased metabolism of glucose through the nonoxidative pathway. In fact, owing to the muscle insulin resistance, glucose is processed mainly by glycolysis that generates lactic acid; it is released into the circulation and returns to the liver, determining an increase of hepatic glucose production (130,135,164,165). Peripheral insulin resistance can also be due to the secretion of hyperthyroidism-induced proinflammatory mediators (IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and several adipokines) by adipocytes (157).\n\nMetabolic changes and glycemic control in patients with TD.\n\nTherefore, hyperthyroidism is associated with a hypermetabolic state with increased energy expenditure and weight loss despite increased appetite and food intake, reduced cholesterol levels, increased lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis. Insulin resistance, which is associated with hyperthyroidism, can be improved with the restoration of euthyroidism (162). Patients with hyperthyroidism can have an increased risk of severe hyperglycemia (166,167), and preexisting DM is exacerbated by hyperthyroidism.\n\nHypothyroidism is characterized by impaired glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, delayed peripheral glucose assimilation, decreased or normal hepatic glucose output, and reduced liver and muscle gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (168) (Fig. 2). Insulin secretion has been reported to be normal, increased, or reduced, and the insulin half-life is prolonged (169).\n\nAdipocytes and skeletal muscle of hypothyroid rats are less responsive to insulin (170\u2013172) because overt and SHypo are associated with decreased glucose transport in myocytes (173). Glucose utilization is slowed in the peripheral tissues, and the rates of glucose oxidation and glycogen synthesis are decreased in hypothyroidism. The inability of insulin to sufficiently maintain glucose utilization by the muscles leads to insulin resistance in patients with subclinical and overt hypothyroidism (174,175).\n\nThe Health ABC study revealed a positive correlation between subclinical and overt hypothyroidism and elevated fasting glucose levels at baseline (176). Several studies have demonstrated higher insulin levels in hypothyroidism with a lower insulin clearance (177). Insulin resistance, in both fasting and postglucose conditions, has been reported in patients with overt and SHypo, with a positive correlation between THs and the Matsuda index (173). The pathogenetic mechanism leading to insulin resistance in hypothyroidism may be related to the dysregulation of the leptin action at the hypothalamic level, the impaired GLUT4 translocation, and the increase in free fatty acids. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport has been found to be decreased in isolated monocytes from patients with overt and SHypo due to impaired translocation of GLUT4 glucose transporters on the plasma membrane, suggesting similar changes in peripheral tissues (173). Moreover, a community-based observational study in healthy subjects, the Fremantle diabetes study, showed that the combination of serum TSH and tissue insulin sensitivity has important effects on serum lipid parameters in T2D, supporting its important contribution to diabetic dyslipidemia (178). Hypothyroid thyroidectomized patients have insulin resistance even after acute L-T4 withdrawal (174).\n\nGlucose-induced insulin secretion by the\u03b2cells is increased in hypothyroidism and is reduced after L-T4 therapy (179). The insulin requirement is decreased in insulin\u2010treated patients with diabetes developing hypothyroidism because of the impaired renal insulin clearance (180\u2013182). Therefore, during treatment with insulin, patients with hypothyroidism with DM require decreased insulin doses and, when exogenous insulin is not decreased, symptomatic hypoglycemia can occur. Uncontrolled and untreated hypothyroidism (overt and SHyo) may induce recurrent hypoglycemic episodes in treated patients with T2D, and a reduction in the insulin dosage should be considered to prevent hypoglycemia. As a result, insulin doses should be modulated with the correction of hypothyroidism, and insulin requirements should be assessed in light of the increased risk of hypoglycemia (182).\n\nIt is essential to recognize TD in patients with DM. However, this diagnosis can be difficult because DM can affect the evaluation of a concomitant TD (Table 4) (183\u2013193). DM influences thyroid function by controlling TSH release at the level of hypothalamus and by affecting T4-to-T3 conversion in the peripheral tissues (183\u2013186). Experimental-induced diabetes may cause alterations in the HPT axis by reducing the levels of plasma TRH and TSH, thereby affecting TH production (183,184). Patients with diabetes may have an impaired TSH response to TRH stimulation with decreased T4-to-T3 conversion. A significant correlation between HbA1c concentration and TSH levels has been reported (187,188).\n\nFactors Limiting the Diagnosis of TD in Patients With DM\n\nThe clinical diagnosis of DM may be delayed in patients with hyperthyroidism and, alternatively, the clinical features of decompensated diabetes may be masked by hyperthyroidism (189). The evaluation of serum TSH and FT3 can provide unreliable results for the coexistence of the low T3 syndrome (190,191). Both T1D and T2D may induce a \u201clow T3\u201d condition with low serum total and FT3 and increased reverse T3 levels. An abnormal TH pattern associated with diabetes was attributed to the presence of TH binding inhibitor (THBI), an inhibitor of the extrathyroidal conversion enzyme (5\u2032-deiodinase) of T4 to T3, and to the dysfunction of the HPT axis (192). These features were exacerbated by stress and poorly controlled diabetes. Additionally, some oral hypoglycemic agents can influence serum TSH levels (193).\n\nHyperthyroidism is successfully treated with antithyroid drugs (ATDs), radioactive iodine (RAI), or surgery. Treatment of hyperthyroidism is recommended by the European Thyroid Association (ETA) and the American Thyroid Association (ATA) in patients with overt disease and in those with severe (grade 2) SHyper in both GD and toxic nodular thyroid disease (194,195) for the increased risk of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, fractures, cognitive dysfunction, and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality (4,5). Treatment of mild (grade 1) SHyper (TSH of 0.1 to 0.4 mU/L) can be considered when serum TSH is persistently low, especially in elderly patients and in those with a high cardiovascular risk (history of atrial fibrillation or stroke, heart failure, and coronary disease) or risk factors for osteoporosis (4,5,194\u2013197). However, no prospective randomized controlled trial has been performed to evaluate whether treatment can improve the adverse outcomes associated with SHyper.\n\nThe choice of appropriate treatment should take into account the etiology and severity of hyperthyroidism, the age of the patients, associated comorbidities, the size of the goiter and patient\u2019s preference. ATDs (e.g., methimazole and propylthiouracil) are appropriate in GD because a spontaneous remission of this autoimmune condition is possible after 12 to 18 months of therapy. Pretreatment with ATDs can be necessary in patients with toxic adenoma and multinodular goiter with severe hyperthyroidism or comorbidies, even though a definitive treatment with thyroid ablation therapy (e.g., RAI or surgery) would be preferred, especially in patients with persistent hyperthyroidism at high risk of adverse cardiac events or fractures (5,194,195) (Fig. 3). Surgery is usually reserved in the presence of large goiters, coexisting hyperparathyroidism, or suspicion of thyroid cancer.\n\nAlgorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of TD in patients with T1D and T2D.\n\nTreatment of hyperthyroidism with ATDs does not affect glycemic control, apart from possible iatrogenic hypothyroidism. Corticosteroids are occasionally used for treatment of Graves ophthalmopathy (GO) or to prevent its exacerbation after the administration of RAI. These drugs may worsen glycemic control or induce diabetes (166). Therefore, the negative effects of administered steroids on metabolic control should be considered in patients with hyperthyroidism and diabetes as well as the onset/exacerbation of GO.\n\nThe adjustment of insulin treatment should be considered in patients with diabetes after the occurrence of hyperthyroidism. The evaluation of thyroid function should be performed during ketoacidosis in patients with clinical symptoms and signs raising a suspicion of hyperthyroidism. However, the hormonal profile should be cautiously considered because of the frequent coexistence of a low T3 syndrome. Hyperglycemia should be reevaluated in subjects with hyperthyroidism after the control of TD.\n\nTreatment of hypothyroidism in adult patients with T2D is simple and available because hypothyroidism is successfully treated with oral L-T4 monotherapy. This treatment is recommended by both the ETA and ATA when serum TSH levels are >10.0 mU/L (198,199) (Fig. 3). Uncontrolled diabetes may impair the effectiveness of L\u2010T4 treatment in hypothyroidism. Alternatively, L-T4 treatment may normalize fasting hyperinsulinemia and significantly improve insulin sensitivity in patients with hypothyroidism and T2D. This could suggest consideration of a potential benefit of L-T4 administration in treating even mild TH deficiency to improve the insulin resistance and dyslipidemia that is associated with SHypo (179). Prospective studies are warranted to address this issue.\n\nPatients with hypothyroidism and DM have reduced insulin requirements, and therefore an increased insulin dose may be necessary when starting treatment with L-T4 (179). Excessive L\u2010T4 therapy inducing TSH suppression should be avoided because it may induce iatrogenic hyperthyroidism and cause a further impairment in glycemic metabolism. The lipid profile is usually partially normalized by L\u2010T4 replacement therapy (178); therefore, combination therapy with statins is frequently required to obtain greater improvement in lipid profile in patients with hypothyroidism. However, the risk of statin\u2010induced myopathy is greater in patients with hypothyroidism and DM (90,200). Accordingly, when required, a lower statin dose should be administered in combination with other lipid\u2010lowering treatments. The use of statins should be considered only after the correction of possible hypothyroidism to prevent the risk of myopathy.\n\nSome antidiabetic drugs can affect thyroid function and impact the HPT axis. Therefore, the use of these drugs in patients with T2D diabetes can influence the evaluation of serum TSH and TH levels (Table 5). Specific recommendations should be considered during treatment with antidiabetic medications (Table 6).\n\nEffect of Antidiabetic Medications on Thyroid Function\n\nRecommendations on the Treatment of TD in Patients With DM\n\nMetformin, an oral hypoglycemic biguanide, is the first drug of choice for treatment of patients with T2D because of its safety profile, efficacy in controlling glycemic levels, and reasonably good compliance and tolerance (201). The main side effect of metformin is gastrointestinal intolerance (diarrhea, nausea, dyspepsia, and abdominal pain), which may be observed in up to 28% of patients and lead to discontinuation of therapy in <2% of patients (201). The TSH-lowering effect of metformin in patients with T2D with primary hypothyroidism was first reported in 2006 (193). Subsequent studies have suggested that metformin may reduce serum TSH levels in patients with primary hypothyroidism; this effect was observed in both patients with hypothyroidism under LT4 replacement therapy and in untreated subjects (202,203).\n\nA meta-analysis assessed the changes in serum TSH levels in 206 patients before and after metformin treatment (204). It included seven studies, of which four studies were performed on 119 patients with overt hypothyroidism receiving L-T4 replacement therapy, two studies on 33 patients with SHypo not receiving L-T4, and one study on 54 euthyroid patients without any L-T4 therapy (204). Six data sets included subjects with diabetes and one study selected women receiving metformin for PCOS (204). The results showed that metformin reduces TSH levels in both overt and SHypo, whereas no change in TSH levels was observed in euthyroid patients (204). The results of this meta-analysis on the nonsignificant effect of metformin on serum TSH in euthyroid individuals were mainly based on one prospective study by Cappelliet al.(203) that examined 54 euthyroid patients with T2D. These data were subsequently confirmed in the cross-sectional study by D\u00edez and Iglesias (205) on 828 patients with T2D and by Rezz\u00f3nicoet al.(206), which included only women with insulin resistance and thyroid nodules. In a second paper, Cappelliet al.(207) performed a large retrospective study on 393 patients with T2D and showed that metformin had a lowering TSH effect in subjects with high-normal basal serum TSH levels (TSH levels >2.5 mU/L) and in patients with hypothyroidism. A retrospective study in seven primary health care centers in Spain assessed 278 patients with T2D (110 females) and evaluated serum TSH levels before and 1 year after the onset of metformin treatment (208). Based on a mathematical model, a TSH cut-off point level of 2.98 mU/L was associated with a lowering effect of metformin (208). Therefore, a serum TSH cut-off of 2.5 to 3 mU/L can predict the effect of metformin on serum TSH.\n\nThe decline in serum TSH levels during treatment with metformin was not associated with alterations in plasma FT4 and FT3 concentrations in the studies previously discussed. Therefore, changes in serum TSH levels were independent from a potential effect of metformin on L-T4 absorption, as demonstrated by the lack of the effects on circulating TH (209,210). Moreover, the effect of metformin was reversible after its discontinuation. Also, thyroid autoimmunity and obesity were not involved in the relationship between metformin and thyroid profile (209,210).\n\nMetformin is able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier and reach a high concentration in the pituitary (211). Therefore, the hypothetical mechanisms for the effect of metformin on serum TSH might be related to the potential effect on TRs or the modulation of the activity of type II deiodinase at the hypothalamic\u2013pituitary level (212). Regarding the underlying mechanism of these effects, potential explanations include the possibilities that metformin might induce changes in the affinity of TRs, TH binding, bioavailability and metabolism of TH, or induce interference with the TSH assay. THs negatively regulate their production through the HPT axis. However, some conditions, such as reduced food availability, may downregulate the HPT axis, even in the presence of normal or lower TH levels (213,214). Metformin mainly acts by suppressing hepatic gluconeogenesis via activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and sirtuin 1 (SIRT1). These effects may probably counteract the hypothalamic T3 action on TSH secretion by inhibiting central AMPK (215). There is also evidence that metformin increases hypothalamic dopaminergic tone in association with improved insulin sensitivity and thereby could modulate the dopaminergic tone on TSH secretion (216). Moreover, metformin might affect deiodinase type 2 (D2) activity in glial cells, astrocytes, and tanycytes in the mediobasal hypothalamus, where D2 catalyzes the conversion of T4 to active T3 (217). Interestingly, D2 polymorphism generating less T3 has been associated with some degrees of insulin resistance, and metformin might enhance D2 activity providing more T3 at the pituitary level in patients with hypothyroidism (218).\n\nIn conclusion, available evidence supports the conclusion that metformin treatment is not associated with a significant modification of TSH values in subjects with an intact HPT axis (209). A TSH-lowering effect of metformin can be observed in patients with diabetes with thyroid disorder, independently of treatment with thyroxine. Although the effect of metformin is yet to be clearly established, literature results suggest that TSH levels should be monitored in patients with diabetes with overt hypothyroidism and SHypo during treatment with metformin. A possible adjunctive role of metformin during L-T4 therapy to obtain TSH suppression in thyroidectomized patients with differentiated thyroid cancer has been reported; it should be further investigated to reduce the adverse effects of exogenous SHyper on the heart and bone (219,220).\n\nRegarding the effects of metformin on thyroid morphology, one study showed that it significantly decreased nodule size by 30% to 50% of the initial volume in patients with insulin resistance (206). More importantly, it has also been reported that metformin exerts an antimitogenic and proapoptotic effect in thyroid carcinoma cell lines and increases the antiproliferative effect of chemotherapeutic agents, such as doxorubicin and cisplatin (221). It inhibits insulin-induced growth stimulation in differentiated and undifferentiated thyroid carcinoma and thyroid cancer stem cells (221).\n\nMoreover, treatment with metformin could suppress the growth of metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) cells by downregulating the mTOR pathway (222). These observations suggest an important potential role of metformin as an adjuvant treatment in the management of thyroid cancer, especially in patients with diabetes.\n\nAntithyroid and goitrogenic activities of sulfonylurea have been reported. In animals receiving large doses of sulfonylureas, the weight of the thyroid gland was increased and iodine content and radioiodine uptake were reduced (223\u2013226). A higher incidence of hypothyroidism was found in patients with diabetes treated with the first-generation sulfonylureas compared with controls treated with diet alone or insulin (227). Chlorpropamide and tolbutamide inhibit the binding of T3 and T4 to T4-binding globulin competitivelyin vitroand after IV administration. In one study they only had a minimal effect after oral administration (228). Studies on the second-generation sulfonylureas demonstrated that glibenclamide and gliclazide had no influence on TH metabolism (229\u2013233). Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to recommend the assessment of serum TSH and FT4 levels and thyroid ultrasound in patients treated with sulfonylureas.\n\nThe thiazolidinediones (TZDs) are among one of several classes of oral hypoglycemic agents commonly used in T2D. They are potent agonists of the nuclear hormone receptor, peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor-\u03b3(PPAR-\u03b3), which is found predominantly in adipose tissue and plays a dominant role in adipocyte differentiation (234). The expression of PPAR-\u03b3is greater in adipose and connective tissue from patients during the active stages of GO. The activation of PPAR-\u03b3by its agonist, TZD, was shown to stimulate functional TSH receptor expression. It also induces the recruitment and differentiation of orbital fibroblasts into mature lipid-laden adipocytes, suggesting that the activation of PPAR-\u03b3may play an important role in the stimulation of adipogenesis and the pathogenesis of GO induced by TZDs (235). Further studies have shown that patients with T2D can have increased eye protrusion during treatment with pioglitazone (234). Exacerbation of GO was described in patients with T2D following treatment with glitazones without apparent changes in TH levels. The withdrawal of pioglitazone treatment did not result in remission of GO (236\u2013239). Thus, TZDs should be administered with caution in patients with diabetes with GD. It seems apparent that pioglitazone should not be administered to patients with diabetes with clinically active GO.\n\nThe results from one study suggest that rosiglitazone use in patients with T2D might reduce the risk of thyroid cancer (240).\n\nIncretins act by increasing the activity of human glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an endogenous hormone released by the intestine in response to food; they are designed as additional treatment to metformin in patients with T2D to improve the control of blood glucose (241). These drugs are able to reduce HbA1c levels without inducing episodes of severe hyoglycaemia and can also induce weight loss in patients who are obese. Incretin mimetics (exenatide) or analogs (liraglutide) act as GLP-1 receptor agonists but are resistant to the degradation of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). Sitagliptin and other similar drugs specifically inhibit DPP-4 and therefore increase the half-life of endogenous GLP-1. Treatment with incretins has been associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer (242), although this risk is controversial and may differ between GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors and among different DPP-4 inhibitors (242). There is weak evidence suggesting an association between sitagliptin and an increased risk of thyroid cancer in Taiwanese patients with T2D, especially during the first year of treatment (242). However, the lack of specific information on the pathology, grading, staging of thyroid cancer, and potential confounders (radiation, smoking, lifestyle, insulin resistance, inflammation, and genetic factors) does not permit examination of the potential mechanism of this association.\n\nGLP-1 promotes\u03b2cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis, stimulates insulin secretion, and reduces blood glucose in human subjects with T2D. GLP-1 controls glycemia via additional actions on glucose sensors, the inhibition of gastric emptying, food intake, and glucagon secretion (241).\n\nSerum calcitonin (CT) is an important biomarker for C cell diseases such as MTC and hereditary C cell hyperplasia (243). Preclinical studies in mice and rats demonstrated that liraglutide activates GLP-1 receptors on the thyroid C cells, causing the release of CT with a dose-dependent effect on C cell pathology (244). Animal models have demonstrated an association between treatment with exenatide or liraglutide and the appearance of abnormalities of thyroid C cells, with progressive development of hyperplasia and adenomas (244\u2013246). These lesions were preceded by an increase in plasma CT levels. Very high doses of liraglutide (45-fold human exposure) caused a small number of C cell carcinomas in female mice. In contrast, C cells within the monkey and human thyroid gland exhibited lower levels of GLP-1 receptor expression and did not respond to GLP-1 receptor agonists with an acute release of CT. Prolonged administration of liraglutide at very high doses did not produce C cell proliferation in monkeys and did not induce significant changes in CT levels in clinical studies in humans compared with controls (247,248). A large population-based randomized study (the LEADER Trial) assessed the long-term effects of the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide on serum CT concentrations during a 3.5- to 5-year period. Unstimulated serum CT concentrations were measured in >9340 patients with T2D receiving liraglutide or placebo (249). The results did not support any effect of GLP-1 receptor activation on serum CT levels, C cell hyperplasia, or C cell malignancy in humans, suggesting that the findings previously reported in rodents may not apply to humans (249). Therefore, there is no evidence for adverse effects of liraglutide in humans. The reported adverse events of this drug can be explained by the greater sensitivity and density of GLP\u20101 receptors in rat C cells as well as the high dosage of the drug when employed in animal models. The Food and Drug Administration stated that patients taking a GLP-1 receptor agonist do not need to be monitored for the potential development of MTC with CT levels. Nevertheless, GLP-1 receptor agonists are not recommended in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia.\n\nInsulin enhances the levels of FT4 and suppresses the level of T3 by inhibiting the hepatic conversion of T4 to T3. Insulin modulates TRH and TSH levels (192). These effects can be worsened in poorly controlled patients with diabetes.\n\nDeiodinases are selenoenzymes that regulate the intracellular concentration of T3, thereby indirectly controlling the response of these tissues to THs. They control the activation and inactivation of T3 and T4 and therefore central and peripheral T3 levels (130,250). Deiodinase type 1 (D1) is expressed predominantly in the liver, kidney, and thyroid in humans. D1 has an important role for the adaptation to iodine deficiency and for reducing the impact of elevated TH levels in hyperthyroidism. D2 is highly expressed in BAT, skeletal muscle, brain, and pituitary and has an essential role in preserving the availability of T3 levels in these tissues. D2 is the main source of circulating levels of T3 in euthyroid subjects (251,252). The T3 generated intracellularly by D2 is transferred to the nucleus and regulates specific gene transcription. Polymorphisms in the D2 gene have been associated with interindividual variation in the TSH-free T4 \u201cset point\u201d (130). Deiodinase type 3 (D3) is predominantly expressed in the adult central nervous system, skin, vascular tissue, placenta, pregnant uterus, and fetal tissues. D3 protects the fetus from excessive maternal TH production. The deiodinase enzymes also differ in their subcellular localization, because D1 and D3 are expressed on the cell membrane, whereas D2 is expressed in the endoplasmic reticulum (130). T3 upregulates the expression of GLUT-4, the insulin-responsive glucose transporter in the skeletal muscle that mediates the rate-limiting step of glucose metabolism and increases glucose uptake. Thus, a lower intracellular D2-generated T3 decreases the transcription rate of GLUT-4 in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and is responsible for an impaired insulin-stimulated glucose disposal resulting in increased insulin resistance and contributing to weight gain (253). A single-nucleotide polymorphism (Thr92Ala) in the coding region of the human D2 gene was associated with increased insulin resistance in subjects with T2D and those who were nondiabetic (254). This polymorphism is extremely prevalent among various ethnic groups. It has been reported that the Ala allele frequencies vary among different populations: Indians (0.61), Han Chinese in Beijing (0.58), Mexican Americans (0.54), African Americans (0.51), British (0.34), and Finnish (0.24) (255). The Thr92Ala variants rs225011 and rs225015 were modestly associated with an early onset of T2D in Pima Indians, although none of these variants was significantly associated with either fasting insulin levels or rates of insulin-mediated glucose uptake (256). Moreover, this gene did not have a large impact on T2D at older ages and did not influence body mass index (BMI) in the Pima Indians. Associations with common D2 Thr92Ala polymorphism with insulin resistance were also found in Mexican Americans and Brazilian cohorts (254,257). A Danish study reported a link between the D2 Ala/Ala genotype and glycemic traits of insulin resistance (258). In this study, an increased area under the serum insulin curve was observed during the oral glucose tolerance test, and an elevated fasting plasma glucose was found in the D2 Ala/Ala group, although no increased risk of T2D was reported (258). However, studies performed in other populations found an inconsistent association between the Thr92Ala D2 variant and insulin resistance and/or T2D (259,260).\n\n\u201cGLP-1 receptor agonists are not recommended in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or type 2 multiple endocrine neoplasia.\u201d\n\nEnvironmental factors and lifestyle could influence the genetic predisposition factors for T2D and explain these conflicting results. Physical exercise might potentially overrule the effects on insulin resistance of the Thr92Ala D2 polymorphism by the exercise-induced increase in translocation of GLUT-4 to the cell membranes (261). Conversely, in sedentary individuals, low intracellular levels of T3 might reduce GLUT-4 transcription, leading to a decreased insulin-stimulated glucose disposal. A recent meta-analysis in 11,000 subjects confirmed the association of the D2 Ala/Ala genotype with increased insulin resistance (increased homeostatic model assessment index) (218). This study demonstrated that this genotype is also linked to a worse glycemic control (increased HbA1c levels) in a cohort of 1057 subjects with T2D (218). In a further meta-analysis, the homozygosis for the D2 Thr92Ala polymorphism was also associated with higher HbA1C levels in patients with T2D, suggesting that this polymorphism might be correlated with a worse glycemic control in patients with T2D (262).\n\nIn conclusion, all available studies underline the potential genetic contribution of D2 Thr92Ala polymorphism to the pathogenesis of T2D.\n\nMetS is characterized by a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors (81). Isulin resistance is the main clinical and pathogenic feature of this syndrome. The definition of MetS is based on central obesity plus any two of the following factors: (i) atherogenic dyslipidemia, with high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or specific treatment of this lipid abnormality; (ii) high blood pressure or antihypertensive treatment; (iii) insulin resistance and elevated fasting plasma glucose concentration or previously diagnosed of T2D (263). A prothrombotic state and a proinflammatory state are usually associated with MetS, which is as an independent risk factor for CVDs and T2D (263,264).\n\nTH affects food intake, resting energy expenditure, and thermogenesis, and consequently metabolic alterations can develop in patients with TD. T3 influences both metabolism and thermogenesis by regulating (i) transcription factors involved in adipogenesis of WAT and BAT, (ii) appetite, and (iii) glucose and lipid metabolism and oxidation (108,109,265,266). Alternatively, the combination of central nutritional state and hormonal signals, including leptin, dopamine, somatostatin, insulin, and adrenergic signaling, integrate information regarding overall nutritional status, circadian rhythms, and stress to modulate TH production (109,130).\n\nTH plays a significant role in energy expenditure through both central and peripheral actions. Obligatory thermogenesis is the generation of heat that accompanies metabolic processes. Facultative thermogenesis is important to maintain body temperature after cold exposure and increase energy expenditure after eating. The primary site of this adaptive thermogenesis in rodents is in BATs (130). The TH plays a major role in regulating both obligatory and adaptive thermogenesis by increasing the basal metabolic rate and by modulating the sympathetic nervous system activation of BAT (108,130) (Fig. 1). TH stimulates basal metabolic rate by increasing ATP production for metabolic processes and by generating and maintaining ion gradients. D2 is expressed in the WAT, BAT, and skeletal muscle and is required for adaptive thermogenesis. There is an important central role for T3 in stimulating adrenergic-mediated thermogenesis due to direct actions on BAT. A central administration of T3 in rats leads to sympathetic nervous system activation and upregulation of BAT thermogenesis via the reduction in the hypothalamic AMP-activated protein kinase activity. The inhibition of this pathway resulted in increased lipogenesis with a net effect of increased thermogenesis and energy expenditure (213,214).\n\nHumans have both visceral and subcutaneous BAT. However, human BAT is considered more important in neonates than in the adults. There is more BAT in younger and leaner individuals and it is induced by cold temperature. Recent studies using positron emission tomography and CT imaging have shown a significant amount of BAT, especially in the subscapular and chest region (265). Although the importance of BAT for metabolic regulation in adults is controversial, functional imaging by positron emission tomography scan has demonstrated BAT activation after overnight cold exposure (266). Treatment with\u03b2-adrenergic blockers reduces BAT activity, suggesting the importance of catecholamine for the development and regulation of BAT. During cold exposure, D2 increases the generation of T3 in BAT, thus promoting heat production (130). The thermogenic effect of T3 in BAT is mediated by UCP1. The expression of UCP1 is required for BAT thermogenesis, and UCP1 is synergistically regulated by both noradreanaline and T3 (267). TR\u03b2regulates UCP1 expression in BAT; TR\u03b1mediates sensitivity to adrenergic simulation. T3 and noradreanaline increase UCP1 expression by twofold separately. On the contrary, when both agents are combined they induce a 20-fold expression of UCP1 (268).\n\nThe hypothalamic area of the brain is critical in the regulation of food intake. It contains the ARC, PVN, ventromedial nucleus (VMN), dorsomedial nucleus, and lateral hypothalamic area/perifornical area. The ARC, which is adjacent to the floor of the third ventricle, is the most important hypothalamic region in controlling appetite and is known as \u2018\u2018the center of food intake.\u201d This area is not fully protected from the circulation by the blood\u2013brain barrier and receives information regarding energy status from peripheral circulating factors produced by peripheral organs such as leptin by adipose tissue, insulin and pancreatic polypeptide by the pancreas, gut hormones (ghrelin, obestatin, GLP-1, oxyntomodulin, peptide YY), and T3 by the thyroid gland (213,269). The ARC is able to integrate these peripheral signals and regulate food intake through expression of orexigenic factors (appetite stimulation) such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP), as well as the expression of anorexigenic factors (appetite inhibition) such as proopiomelanocortin (POMC), which encodes for\u03b1-melanocyte\u2013stimulating hormone (\u03b1-MSH) and cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) (270\u2013273) (Fig. 1). Both NPY and AgRP increase food intake when administered intracerebroventricularly (ICV) to rats, whereas CART and\u03b1-MSH inhibit food intake when administered ICV. The NPY/AgRP and POMC/CART neurons from the ARC are extensively connected to other hypothalamic areas, including the lateral hypothalamic area and perifornical area. This last area is the site of production of other orexigenic neuropeptides, melanin-concentrating hormone, and the orexins. The ICV administration of orexins increases food intake.\n\nThe brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is highly expressed in the VMN. The central infusion of BDNF reduces food intake and induces weight loss in rats (274). The VMN receives NPY/AgRP, and POMC neuronal projections from the ARC and POMC neurons from the ARC play a role in activating BDNF neurons in the VMN to decrease the food intake (275). The TRH, secreted from the hypothalamus, has direct anorectic effects and can regulate food intake independent of effects on the HPT axis. In rodents, central and peripheral administration of TRH reduces food intake (276). TSH has also been shown to reduce food intake when injected centrally into rats and could be involved with the seasonal alterations in food intake and body weight that occur in some species (277,278). T3 in the brain is crucial for the feedback regulation of TSH secretion. T3 directly stimulates food intake at the level of the hypothalamus, independently of changes in energy expenditure. In rodent models, peripheral and central hypothalamic administration of T3 increases food intake (279). In fact, T3 can directly cross the blood\u2013brain barrier, and the central administration of T3 activates the mTOR signaling pathway and is associated with increased expression of AgRP and NPY, as well as decreased POMC expression in hypothalamic ARC (280,281). Direct administration of T3 into the VMN increases food intake in rats (282). The effects of T3 in the VMN may be mediated by glutamatergic neurons that modulate ARC POMC neurons and/or BDNF neurons (282).\n\nD2 activity is particularly high in the ARC and median eminence, where it is expressed within astrocytes and tanycytes (130) in direct contact with NPY/AgRP neurons. Despite the reductions in peripheral and liver T3 levels during fasting, hypothalamic D2 activity is increased with fasting, resulting in an increase in local hypothalamic T3 production and a consequent mitochondrial proliferation in NPY/AgRP neurons, leading to increased appetite. Hypothalamic D2 mRNA shows a diurnal variation, peaking in the nocturnal feeding phase in rats. This suggests that local production of T3 in the hypothalamus may be involved in appetite regulation and supports the hypothesis that the mechanism to stimulate arcuate NPY/AgRP neurons may have an important physiological role in the regulation of food intake (283,284).\n\n\u201cThe administration of leptin to normal weight rodents produces a dramatic reduction in food intake and body weight\u2026.\u201d\n\nLeptin is an adipokine and its serum concentration is proportional to body fat content. Leptin acts on the hypothalamus to influence food intake (Fig. 1). The administration of leptin to normal weight rodents produces a dramatic reduction in food intake and body weight because leptin directly activates anorectic POMC neurons and inhibits orexigenic AgRP/NPY neurons (285). Both leptin and TH regulate signaling in the ACN (286\u2013288). Leptin levels are reduced in hyperthyroidism, correlating with BMI.\n\nInsulin has anorectic effects in the central nervous system and its ICV administration reduces food intake and body weight (289) (Fig. 1). Its anorectic effect involves insulin receptors on ARC neurons (289). Insulin binds to the insulin receptor and activates the insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. These in turn allow IRS proteins to activate the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway. It is interesting that this IRS/phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase pathway is also activated by leptin, and therefore the similar effects of leptin and insulin on food intake may be mediated via this common pathway in the hypothalamus (290). Hypoglycemia potently stimulates food intake; however, this effect is due to low glucose, not elevated insulin. Arcuate NPY/AgRP neurons do not respond directly to hypoglycemia, but their activation during glucoprivation depends on catecholamine projections from the hindbrain (291,292).\n\nThe hyperthyroidism-induced increase in food intake is associated with the dysregulation of the hypothalamic neuropeptide system, including increased NPY and AgRP expression, and decreased POMC expression in ARC. T3-treated rats have significantly lower plasma leptin levels compared with control rats; hypothalamic expression of NPY mRNA is increased fourfold, and hypothalamic POMC and CART mRNA are reduced by \u223c80%, compared with control rats. The hyperthyroidism-induced increase in food intake is reversed by central treatment with the specific mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, resulting in weight loss (280,281,293). Despite increased appetite, hyperthyroidism is usually associated with a variable decrease in body weight owing to the increase in total energy expenditure (108). Oppositely, the correction of hyperthyroidism may be responsible for excessive weight gain, independent of the treatment modality of thyrotoxicosis, that is, surgery, RAI, or ATDs (108).\n\nRegarding hypothyroidism, weight excess was reported in 54% patients with overt hypothyroidism, reflecting both the accumulation of body fat, due to decreased resting energy expenditure, and the increased water content of the body, consequent to a reduced capacity of excreting free water (108). In spite of adequate replacement therapy with L-T4 and the increase in resting energy expenditure, hypothyroid patients usually have only a modest and/or transient weight loss prevalently due to the excretion of excess body water, rather than reduction in fat mass (108).\n\nObesity can induce insulin resistance and diabetes because the adipose tissue is an active endocrine tissue; it releases free fatty acids, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and other products that play an important major role in glucose and lipid metabolism (294). An early marker for the risk of diabetes is the increased accumulation of lipid within nonadipose tissue, including the skeletal muscle and liver. Inflammation within the adipose tissue, particularly related to obesity and high fat consumption, may contribute to systemic insulin resistance (295).\n\nTD is associated with changes in body weight and composition, body temperature, and total and resting energy expenditure independently of physical activity (108,109,296). Both subclinical and overt hypothyroidism are frequently associated with weight gain, decreased thermogenesis, and metabolic rate (297,298). Moreover, slight variations in thyroid function, even within the laboratory reference range, can be associated with the development of regional obesity and the tendency to gain weight (299,300). The NHANES 2007\u20132008 analysis of 3114 euthyroidhealthy men and women showed that TSH levels and FT3 were correlated with BMI and waist circumference (301). Moreover, raising TSH levels has been linked to a progressive increase in weight over time (296). The correlation between TSH and BMI could be mediated by leptin produced by adipose tissue because a positive correlation has been identified between serum leptin and serum TSH levels in individuals who are obese. TSH in turn can stimulate leptin secretion by human adipose tissue via TSH receptors that are expressed on adipocytes (287,302,303).\n\nIn vivo, the administration of recombinant human TSH at supraphysiological doses can induce the release of small, but significant amounts of leptin, which are proportional to the adipose mass (304). Leptin can also regulate D2, activating the conversion of T4 to T3 (296).\n\nIsolated hyperthyrotropinemia is frequently observed in patients who are obese. It is a condition spontaneously reversible by losing weight without the necessity of specific treatment; in fact, it is usually associated with FT3 levels that are at the upper limit of the normal range (296). Alternatively, individuals who are morbidly obese show a high prevalence of overt and subclinical autoimmune hypothyroidism, accounting for 19.5% of hypothyroidsm (305,306). A link has been reported between obesity, TSH increase, leptin increase, thyroid autoimmunity, alterations and development of subclinical and overt hypothyroidism, and deranged lipid profile, thereby bringing the thyroid/obesity association to a full circle (296,306).\n\nIndices of insulin resistance are closely linked to TSH and TH levels, even within the normal range in euthyroid eumetabolic subjects (106,307\u2013311). In a Korean study on 6241 nondiabetic euthyroid subjects, those with the lowest FT4 quartile had twice the risk of insulin resistance when compared with those in the highest quartile after adjusting for age, sex, metabolic, and lifestyle factors (312). In healthy euthyroid middle-aged subjects, FT3 and FT4 levels and the FT3/FT4 ratio were associated with various markers of unfavorable metabolic profile and cardiovascular risk (313). Furthermore, it has been shown that in both euthyroid adults with and without diabetes, small variations in TSH at different levels of insulin sensitivity might exert a marked effect on lipid levels (314). Regarding the effects of insulin on the thyroid gland, high circulating levels of insulin may induce increased thyroid proliferation with the development of larger thyroid volume and the formation of nodules. This goitrogenic action of insulin may explain why the thyroid gland was considered another victim of the insulin resistance syndrome (315).\n\nThe lipid status is affected by TD (316,317). THs modulate cholesterol synthesis, mobilization, and breakdown. In particular, they increase cholesterol synthesis via the rate-limiting enzyme 3-OH-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and, in turn, stimulate its removal by enhancing the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver (318). An increase of total cholesterol and its subfractions is a common finding in hypothyroidism, and a direct relationship between serum TSH and total cholesterol levels has been described (318). Reduced expression of the hepatic LDL receptor gene, responsible for an impaired cholesterol clearance, may contribute to hypercholesterolemia in patients with hypothyroidism (318). The elevation of triglycerides in hypothyroidism is due to a decrease in the activity of hepatic triglyceride lipase (318).\n\nOvert hypothyroidism is associated with hyperlipidemia, and even SHypo has been related to alterations in plasma lipids, although with conflicting results (319). Data from the EPIC-Norfolk study showed a higher total and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in women with SHypo and reported that, even in the euthyroid population, there were associations between TSH levels and lipid profiles (320). Other studies confirmed that the association between TSH and total cholesterol and LDL-C remained significant after the adjustment for age and sex (299,321,322). In the HUNT Study, among 30,656 euthyroid individuals, serum TSH levels within the euthyroid range were positively and significantly associated with total cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides, with an inverse relationship between serum TSH and HDL-C (323). Higher TSH levels were also associated with higher triglycerides and lower HDL; furthermore, this relationship was stronger among individuals who were overweight (BMI >25 kg/m2) (323). Moreover, serum TSH was positively associated with total cholesterol and triglycerides among a cohort of 2771 euthyroid Hispanic individuals, and serum-free T4 was positively correlated with serum HDL-C (311).\n\nTwo meta-analyses found that systolic (324,325) and diastolic blood pressure (325) were higher in the group with SHypo than in euthyroid controls.\n\nOne of the mechanisms that links the MetS with hepatic steatosis is the insulin stimulation of lipogenesis, which can lead to fatty liver and worsen insulin resistance (326). Longitudinal studies support the association of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease with either T2D or MetS. Moreover, SHypo and high serum TSH levels were associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (327\u2013329).\n\nAll of these studies suggest that atherogenic dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and hypertension can be linked with overt and subclinical hypothyroid states, and consequently TH deficiency is significantly associated with some components of MetS.\n\nThe prevalence of MetS was reported to be 44% in patients with hypothyroidism and 35% in patients with SHypo compared with 33% in the control group (P= 0.016) (330). A significant increase in the odds of having MetS was found in participants with marked SHypo (TSH 10 to 20 mU/L). Two meta-analysis of cross-sectional studies concluded that SHypo might be associated with an increased risk of MetS (331,332). However, heterogeneity was observed among the included studies because the authors did not apply a uniform definition of MetS for their study design and data synthesis. Another meta-analysis assessed the association between MetS and SHypo by employing the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for MetS (333). Although this study did not report a significant difference in MetS prevalence between individuals with SHypo and euthyroid individuals (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.95 to 1.34), the prevalence of central obesity (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.04 to 1.96) was significantly higher in the group with SHypo, and hypertriglyceridemia was prevalent in the female group with SHypo (333).\n\n\u201c\u2026all subjects with T1D should undergo annual functional screening by serum TSH measurement to detect asymptomatic TD\u2026.\u201d\n\nThere are reports on higher TSH levels in patients with MetS than in healthy ones, as well as a high prevalence of MetS in subjects with TSH levels higher than normal when compared with those with normal TSH levels (176,334). Even high-normal serum TSH levels and low-normal free T4 levels have been significantly associated with increased prevalence of MetS (335).\n\nA large population-based study of older adults reported that increasing TSH levels were associated with greater odds of having MetS and found a significant association between continuous serum TSH levels and prevalent MetS among euthyroid participants (176). A study on a euthyroid German cohort (mean age 52 years) found that TSH in the upper normal range (2.5 to 4.5 mU/L) was associated with a 1.7-fold increased risk of MetS compared with a low-normal TSH (0.3 to 2.5 mU/L) (336). Euthyroid subjects with TSH values in the upper normal range (2.5 to 4.5 mU/L) were more obese (BMI >30 kg/m2), had higher triglyceride levels, and had an increased likelihood of having MetS (336). Another study on 1000 euthyroid postmenopausal women in Korea (mean age 59 years) reported an OR for MetS of 1.9 in participants with the highest vs lowest quartiles of TSH (337). Interestingly, the prevalence of MetS decreased significantly from the higher to lower FT4 tertiles within the euthyroid range (30.1% in the lowest FT4 tertile to 22.4% in the highest FT4 tertile) (P< 0.001) (107). Higher FT4 values were associated with lower odds of MetS (OR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.92 to 0.99;P= 0.01) (107). Moreover, an association between FT4 and lipids in MetS was demonstrated (106).\n\nAll of these data suggest that there is a higher prevalence of metabolic abnormalities with increasing serum TSH levels.\n\nBoth MetS and hypothyroidism are independent risk factors for CVDs (338). The MetS has been linked to CVD and mortality in the general population (263,338,339). This high cardiovascular risk could be further increased when metabolic syndrome is associated with TH deficiency (340). SHypo was considered a risk factor for MetS (341). Consequently, a considerable overlap may occur in the pathogenetic mechanisms of atherosclerotic disease correlated with MetS and hypothyroidism (Fig. 4).\n\nThe pathogenetic mechanism for atherosclerotic disease correlates with hypothyroidism and MetS.\n\nDM is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Patients with DM have an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, heart failure, kidney disease, blindness, amputations, and neuropathy (342\u2013344). DM caused 1.5 million deaths in 2012, with an excess relative risk of mortality, ranging from 1.15 to 3.15, mainly attributable to cardiovascular causes (345\u2013349).\n\nEpidemiological studies have shown an increased cardiovascular risk in patients with subclinical and overt hypothyroidism (350). Insulin resistance, diastolic hypertension, increased systemic vascular resistance, increased arterial stiffness, endothelial dysfunction, and altered coagulability represent the main risk factors responsible for the increased cardiovascular mortality associated with TH deficiency (4). Individual participant data meta-analyses reported that SHypo was associated with an increased risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) events and mortality (350) and heart failure (351), especially in patients with serum TSH >10 mU/L.\n\nThe onset of TD can further increase the long-term morbidity and mortality associated with diabetes. The coexistence of both diabetes and thyroid disorders may worsen the risk of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) in patients with diabetes (352\u2013354). DR, a common microvascular complication of diabetes, can be completely asymptomatic until a significant visual impairment occurs, and patients often miss the opportunity for appropriate treatment. Risk factors for the development of DR include duration of diabetes, poor glycemic control, elevated blood pressure, and dyslipidemia (355). SHypo is linked to DR (353,354). A meta-analysis including eight epidemiological studies confirmed this association showing that the onset of SHypo increased the risk of DR by 2.13-fold (95% CI, 1.41 to 3.23;P< 0.001) compared with euthyroid individuals (356).\n\nA growing body of evidence suggests that hypothyroidism is a risk factor for incident chronic kidney disease, progression of chronic kidney disease , and higher death risk in kidney disease patients (352,357). SHypo was associated with albuminuria in patients with T2D, and an increased serum TSH was an independent risk factor for the presence of albuminuria (357). A greater prevalence of DN was reported in a cross-sectional analysis on 588 patients with T2D and SHypo compared with euthyroid individuals (352). SHypo was associated with an OR of 3.15 (95% CI, 1.48 to 6.69) for the development of DN and was also responsible for an increased risk of cardiovascular events mediated by DN (352).\n\nThere are conflicting results on cardiovascular mortality in patients with diabetes and TH deficiency (358,359). Patients with diabetes have up to a sixfold higher risk of future CHD events compared with nondiabetic individuals (360\u2013362). The coexistence of both T2D and thyroid diseases could further increase the risk of CHD (363).\n\nA meta-analysis of 36 articles assessed the prevalence of complications in patients with T2D with SHypo (103). The risks of diabetic microangiopathy and macroangiopathy were evaluated by assessing the risk of DN and DR, peripheral arterial disease (PAD), CHD, and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN). The OR for DN was 1.74 (95% CI, 1.34 to 2.28) when pooling data from 10 studies, which included 869 individuals with T2D with SHypo compared with 3892 euthyroid individuals with T2D. The OR for DR was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.21 to 1.67) when pooling the results from 10 studies that enrolled 835 individuals with T2D with SHypo and 3737 euthyroid individuals with T2D. The OR for CHD was 1.59 (95% CI, 0.92 to 2.76) when pooling data from 10 studies that included 579 individuals with T2D with SHypo and 1317 euthyroid individuals with T2D. The pooled OR for PAD was 1.85 (95% CI, 1.35 to 2.54) when pooling data from four studies that included 312 cases and 489 controls. The pooled OR for DPN was 1.87 (95% CI, 1.06 to 3.28) when pooling data from three studies that included of 420 individuals with T2D with SHypo and 1290 euthyroid individuals with T2D. Therefore, the authors concluded that SHypo is prevalent in patients with T2D and may be responsible for a greater risk of diabetic complications such as DN, DR, PAD, and DPN, but not CHD (103).\n\nDM and TD are among the most common endocrinopathies during pregnancy. Hypothyroidism can be responsible for a variety of adverse effects in pregnancy outcomes and offspring- and pregnancy-related complications (364,365). The prevalence of hypothyroidism in women during the reproductive age is 2% to 3%, and chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is the main cause of hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Pregnancy has a profound impact on thyroid gland morphology and function. TH and daily iodine requirements increase during pregnancy because of important changes in the thyroid function and renal iodine excretion (364\u2013366). Serum FT4 decreases whereas TSH gradually rises within normal limits during pregnancy owing to the influence of increasing concentrations of T4-binding globulin and the transplacental transfer of FT4. Moreover, the turnover of FT4 is increased for the enhanced activity of placental type III deiodinase. This trend is further increased in women with HT, leading to an increased risk of TH deficiency during pregnancy (364\u2013366). Severe maternal hypothyroidism is associated with an increased risk of adverse pregnancy complications (fetal death, premature birth, low birth weight, pregnancy loss, and gestational hypertension) as well as detrimental effects on fetal neurocognitive development, leading to a lower intelligence quotient in the offspring (364\u2013366). An increased risk of pregnancy complications is also associated with SHypo, especially in TPO Ab-positive women (364\u2013366). Recent guidelines have recommended treating overt and SHypo on the basis of these adverse effects, especially in TPO Ab-positive women with a TSH greater than the pregnancy-specific reference range (364,365). Moreover, the ATA guidelines have recommended L-T4 therapy for TPO Ab-negative women with a TSH >10.0 mIU/per liter (365), whereas the ETA guidelines recommend L-T4 replacement in women with SHypo who are TPO Ab-negative (364).\n\nGestational DM (GDM) is defined by the World Health Organization as \u201cany degree of glucose intolerance with the onset or first recognition during pregnancy\u201d (367,368). The prevalence of GDM in pregnant women ranges from 1.7% to 20%, with a wide difference according to country, screening strategy, and diagnostic criteria (367,369\u2013371). The incidence of T2D in pregnant women is increased with both maternal age and increasing prepregnancy BMI (367\u2013371). Moreover, pregnant women with a family history of diabetes have a much higher incidence of GDM than do those without a family history of diabetes (367\u2013371). Patients with poorly controlled DM may have up to a 50% increased risk of pregnancy loss (372). Women diagnosed with GDM should receive lifelong screening for prediabetes and T2D because they have an increased risk for the development of T2D after delivery (368,373).\n\nThe incidence of TD during pregnancy in women with T1D is threefold higher than in the general population, particularly in the first trimester of pregnancy and in the first year postpartum (374). TD was observed in 22.5% of women with T1D in the first trimester and 18.4% in the third trimester; the prevalent form of TD was subclinical or overt hypothyroidism (374). Alternatively, pregnant women with hypothyroidism or isolated hypothyroxinemia can have adverse metabolic characteristics (e.g., raised blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin resistance, and gestational diabetes) (375\u2013377). A meta-analysis of six cohort studies showed that the incidence of GDM in patients with SHypo was 1.35-fold higher than the incidence in the control group (378). The risk for gestational diabetes is increased even in women with high TSH levels within the normal reference range (378). A large meta-analysis reported that the presence of thyroid autoantibodies did not increase the risk of GDM in euthyroid pregnant women, and their positivity in the first trimester did not have a predictive value for the risk of GDM (379). Conversely, the combination of high serum TSH and thyroid autoimmunity in early pregnancy was associated with a fourfold increased risk for GMD (RR, 4.3; 95% CI, 2.1 to 8.9) and a threefold increased risk for low birth weight neonates (RR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.2 to 8.0) after adjustment for several confounders (380).\n\nA prospective study of 6031 Chinese pregnant women showed that low FT4 levels during pregnancy were a risk factor for GDM and preeclampsia (381). Conversely, the incidence of GDM decreased in women with higher FT4 levels, showing a protective effect for the development of GDM (382). GDM can induce adverse outcomes such as miscarriage, excessive fetal growth, birth trauma, and neonatal metabolic abnormalities. These complications may be further increased when hypothyroidism develops in patients with GMD (365). Additionally, women with GDM are at a high risk of developing chronic hypertension and vascular complications (383,384). An association has been reported between overt hypothyroidism during pregnancy and subsequent diabetes morbidity later in life (385).\n\nPostpartum thyroiditis (PPTD) is caused by a destructive autoimmune thyroiditis in the postpartum period, mediated by a rebound of both cellular and humoral immunity. The clinical presentation can vary from hyperthyroidism to hypothyroidism or both and is associated with a significant increased incidence of depression (386). PPTD developed in up to 25% to 38% of women with T1D (387,388). The incidence of PPTD is threefold to fourfold higher in women with T1D compared with unselected populations (388,389).\n\nThe screening of TD and PPTD is recommended in pregnant women with T1D or other autoimmune disorders by the ATA/American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (365), the Endocrine Society (390), the British Thyroid Association (BTA) (391), and the American Diabetes Association (ADA) (392\u2013394). The ATA/ACE and the Endocrine Society also recommend the screening of TD in women with morbid obesity (BMI \u226540 kg/m2), TPO positivity, family or personal history of TD, and age >30 years, before and after pregnancy (365,390). TSH and TPO Abs should be evaluated in women with T1D planning pregnancy or at the beginning of pregnancy. When thyroid function is normal, the screening should be repeated in the first trimester. In case of positive TPO Abs and normal serum TSH during pregnancy, it is essential to recheck thyroid function at 3, 6, and 12 months after delivery. Screening for postpartum thyroiditis is recommended in patients with T1D at 3 and 6 months postpartum (390).\n\nTD is a frequent condition in patients with T1D with a rising prevalence with age. The onset of TD is responsible for poorly controlled T1D because overt or SHypo can be associated with increased risk of symptomatic hypoglycemia whereas hyperthyroidism alters glucose metabolism, potentially resulting in the deterioration of metabolic control.\n\nThe assessment of TD in patients with T1D meets the criteria for a screening program because of the following points: (i) TD and type 1 DM are frequently linked; (ii) clinical and laboratory diagnoses can be easily performed; (iii) the delay or lack of diagnosis of TD may worsen the prognosis of T1D; and (iv) an effective therapy for TD and diabetes is available (Table 7). Therefore, the cost-benefit ratio could be favorable for TD screening in T1D.\n\nMajor Criteria Supporting the Screening of TD in Patients With Type 1 DM\n\nConsistent with these considerations, screening for TD is currently recommended in children, adolescents, and adults with T1D by the ATA (199), BTA (391), ADA (392\u2013394), American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (395), and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (396).\n\nThe BTA (391), ADA (392\u2013394), and the International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (396) recommend that thyroid Ab tests and thyroid function should be considered close to the time of diagnosis of T1D and repeated when clinical symptoms suggest the possibility of thyroid disease. Thyroid tests should be rechecked every year. Therefore, all subjects with T1D should undergo annual functional screening by serum TSH measurement to detect asymptomatic TD, particularly those with positive TPO Abs. L-T4 replacement therapy should be started in diabetic patients with overt, subclinical, and mild hypothyroidism to reduce the risk of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerotic heart disease (4,198,199). The evaluation and treatment of hyperthyroidism should be started in patients with suppressed serum TSH and elevated TH levels (194,195). According to the ADA, the screening of TD should include TSH, TPO Abs, and thyroglobulin Abs (392\u2013394). The ADA specifies that TSH should be measured after obtaining satisfactory glycemic control. Long-term follow-up should include a periodic assessment of thyroid function (with TSH determination). Thus, tests should be run at 1- to 2-year intervals when TPO Abs are initially negative and more frequent (up to every 6 months) when TPO Abs are positive or when there are symptoms of TD such as goiter, abnormal growth rate in pediatric age, or unexplained glycemic variation. The US Preventive Services Task Force did not have specific recommendations about T1D (397). However, in general, it suggested that the screening of TD should be performed by means of thyroid autoantibodies and serum TSH because they are the most sensitive ways of identifying patients with thyroid autoimmunity and TD (397). Multiple tests during 3 to 6 months should be performed to confirm or rule out any abnormal findings. Follow-up testing of serum T4 levels in persons with persistently abnormal TSH levels can differentiate between subclinical (normal T4) and overt (abnormal T4) TD (397). All of these recommendations confirm the importance of screening TD in patients with T1D andvice versato improve symptoms, quality of life, and prognosis (seeTable 8for a summary of guidleines) (391\u2013398).\n\nSummary of Guidelines on a Screening Program for TD in Patients With T1D and T2D, in the General Population, and in Pregnant Patients\n\nAbbreviations: AACE, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists; ISPAD, International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes; Ref., reference; USPTF, US Preventive Task Force.\n\nThe possible coexistence or potential onset of T1D in AITD patients, especially in the case of younger subjects and/or a family history of T1D, can be evaluated by measuring fasting glucose, HbA1c, islet cell Abs, and glutamic acid decarboxylase Abs at the time of diagnosis of AITD. In case of a T1D\u2013AITD association, a genetic study is advised along with a serological screening of first-degree relatives in the context of probable APS (21). Owing to the well-known increased clustering of both endocrine and nonendocrine autoimmune diseases in patients with coexistent T1D and AITD (APS3) and their relatives, serological screening with the measurement of the glandular autoantibodies is recommended in all APS3 patients and their first-degree relatives (19\u201322). When serological screening is positive, functional testing follows. Also recommended is the serological screening for the prevalent autoimmune nonendocrine disorders in APS, that is, celiac disease, autoimmune gastritis, pernicious anemia, and Sj\u00f6gren syndrome. Typing of the MHC HLA class II DR/DQ antigens and eventually testing the PTPN22 and CTLA-4 SNPs help differentiate between patients with polyglandular vs monoglandular autoimmunity (32,33,399).\n\nA longitudinal evaluation of thyroid function should be subsequently monitored every 1 to 2 years or obtained at any time growth rate is abnormal.\n\nT2D accounts for \u223c14% of the health expenditure (US$245 billion last year) in the United States to treat complications such as myocardial infarction, stroke, retinopathy, end-stage renal disease, and care for ulcerative lesions (400). Regarding the screening of T2D, the ADA suggests the screening of this disorder at the age of 45 years as well as screening younger adults who are overweight with one or more of the following risk factors: (i) a positive family history of diabetes; (ii) coming from high-risk minority ethnic/racial groups; (iii) the presence of hyperlipidemia; (iv) being physically inactive; (v) experiencing signs/symptoms of insulin resistance (i.e., acanthosis nigricans, polycystic ovarian syndrome, history of GMD, previous prediabetes diagnosis); and/or (vi) the presence of hypertension or treatment of hypertension (390) (Table 9). The ADA recommends rescreening patients with these risk factors only every 3 years based on the rationale that someone who tests negative would be highly unlikely to develop the disease complications within the 3-year time period (392\u2013394).\n\nBenefits and Limits of a Screening Program in Patients With T2DM\n\nRegarding the screening of TD, the ATA recommends that adults should be screened by the measurement of serum TSH concentration, beginning at age 35 years and every 5 years thereafter (398). This screening is justified because it is cost-effective within the context of the periodic health examination. Moreover, the ATA suggests that individuals with symptoms and signs potentially attributable to TD and those with risk factors for its development may require more frequent TSH testing (398). Conversely, despite the potential association between TD and CVD, the US Preventive Services Task Force concluded that there is no clear evidence for the necessity of a screening program of TD in asymptomatic subjects (397).\n\nThe necessity of a screening program for TD in patients with T2D is a controversial issue because current evidence is insufficient to assess the specific tests for screening (TSH alone, TSH and TPO Abs, or TSH and FT4), the exact interval of periodic screening, and the cost-benefit ratio. The ADA recommends thyroid palpation in all diabetic patients and the evaluation of serum TSH in adults >50 years of age and in patients with dyslipidemia (392\u2013394). The ATA recommends testing TSH at the diagnosis of diabetes and every 5 years thereafter (398). According to the BTA, thyroid function tests are recommended in T2D only when there is a suspicion of an AITD (391). They suggest that patients with T2D should have their thyroid function checked at diagnosis, but routine annual thyroid function testing is not recommended.\n\nHowever, most of the available guidelines are too general and not detailed regarding routine screening and monitoring of T2D and TD. Even current guidelines from the ETA (194,198) and ATA (195,199,401) do not specifically address screening of thyroid function or treatment of TD in individuals with T2D.\n\nThe following considerations could support the benefit of an early detection of TD in patients with T2D: (i) TD, especially hypothyroidsm, is frequently observed in patients with T2D; (ii) many patients with T2D may be asymptomatic even in the presence of overt hypothyroidism; (iii) clinical symptoms of TD may be masked by a poor metabolic control, which is more frequent when TD develops; (iv) undetected thyroid disorders may compromise the metabolic control and amplify the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with T2D; and (v) the screening of TD may allow early treatment, preventing high cardiovascular and metabolic complications (Table 9).\n\nConversely, the subsequent considerations may limit the necessity of a screening program for TD in patients with T2D: (i) there is evidence that the mild form of STDs can progress at a low rate (<1% during 5 years), suggesting a long-term screening program; (ii) it is difficult to diagnose TD in T2D patients for the frequent association of comorbidity and drug interferences; (iii) some oral antidiabetic drugs interfere with the evaluation of serum TSH levels; and (iv) the use of age-specific TSH range should be considered to avoid misdiagnosis of hypothyroidism in elderly patients with T2D (3,4) (Table 9).\n\nAll of these considerations support that the evaluation of serum TSH alone could be inappropriate for screening or monitoring TD in patients with T2D, even in those with an acute presentation of DM such as ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar conditions, and hypoglycemic episodes. The assessment of both FT4 and TPO could be necessary in a screening program, but this assessment further increases the cost of screening.\n\nTherefore, there is insufficient evidence to evaluate whether a specific screening of TD policy is necessary in T2D. These uncertainties do not allow us to adopt specific recommendations from the guidelines published by the major endocrine and diabetes societies (seeTable 8for a summary of guidelines) (391\u2013398).\n\nMore studies are needed to better understand the possible role of TD in the development and progression of DM andvice versa. In the future, the use of more sensitive peripheral markers of thyroid function may help clinicians to identify and personalize the treatment of TD in patients with diabetes, particularly in those in which these disorders are difficult to manage.\n\nLarge prospective studies are necessary to clarify the adverse effects of TD and DM when associated. Randomized controlled trials could verify whether the treatment of thyroid disorders can counteract the expected risks. Futures studies assessing TD in the early stage and performing an adequate treatment of TD in patients with DM could help understand the prognosis of these associated disorders when appropriately treated.\n\nThe discovery of TH analogs to improve metabolic control may help clinicians improve the cardiovascular risk factors associated with DM, MetS, and TH deficiency.\n\nFuture studies could clarify the potential role of metformin to improve TSH suppression therapy with L-T4 in patients with differentiated thyroid cancer and the prognosis of medullary thyroid cancer.\n\nFinally, specific guidelines are necessary to recommend a systematic approach for the correct diagnosis and treatment of TD in patients with T1D and T2D.\n\nFinancial Support:This work was supported by National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases Grant RO-1 38325-35 (to P.R.R.).\n\nDisclosure SummaryThe authors have nothing to disclose.\n\nantibody\n\nAmerican Diabetes Association\n\nagouti-related protein\n\nautoimmune thyroid disease\n\nantigen-presenting cell\n\nautoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 3 variant\n\narcuate nucleus\n\nAmerican Thyroid Association\n\nantithyroid drug\n\nbrown adipose tissue\n\nbrain-derived neurotrophic factor\n\nbody mass index\n\nBritish Thyroid Association\n\ncocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript\n\ncoronary heart disease\n\nC-type lectin domain family 16 member A\n\ncalcitonin\n\ncytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen\n\ncardiovascular disease\n\ndeiodinase type 1\n\ndeiodinase type 2\n\ndeiodinase type 3\n\ndiabetes mellitus\n\ndiabetic nephropathy\n\ndiabetic peripheral neuropathy\n\ndipeptidyl peptidase-4\n\ndiabetic retinopathy\n\nEuropean Thyroid Association\n\nforkhead box P3\n\nGraves disease\n\ngestational DM\n\nglucagon-like peptide-1\n\nglucose transporter\n\nGraves ophthalmology\n\nhigh-density lipoprotein\n\nHDL cholesterol\n\nhuman leukocyte antigen\n\nhepatocyte nuclear factor\n\nhypothalamic\u2013pituitary\u2013thyroid\n\nHashimoto thyroiditis\n\nintracerebroventricular(ly)\n\nIL-2 receptor\u03b1\n\ninsulin receptor substrate\n\nlow-density lipoprotein\n\nLCL cholesterol\n\nlymphoid tyrosine phosphatase\n\nmetabolic syndrome\n\nmajor histocompatibility complex\n\nmaturity-onset diabetes of the young\n\nmedullary thyroid carcinoma\n\nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey\n\nneuropeptide Y\n\nperipheral arterial disease\n\nphosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase\n\nproopiomelanocortin\n\nperoxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor-\u03b3\n\npostpartum thyroiditis\n\nprotein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor type 22\n\nparaventricular nucleus\n\nradioactive iodine\n\nrelative risk\n\nsubclinical hyperthyroidism\n\nsubclinical hypothyroidism\n\nsingle nucleotide polymorphism\n\nsubclinical thyroid disorder\n\nthyroid dysfunction\n\nthyroid hormone\n\ntype 1 diabetes\n\ntype 2 diabetes\n\nthyroperoxidase\n\nTH receptor\n\nthiazolidinedione\n\nuncoupling protein\n\nventromedial nucleus\n\nwhite adipose tissue\n\nArticles from Endocrine Reviews are provided here courtesy ofThe Endocrine Society"

Albeit the underlying cause of the disease remains unclear in the vast majority of the cases, ~10% are of secondary origin. Endocrine disorders are common illnesses and some of them may lead to elevated blood pressure, among which thyroid diseases are of high prevalence and often overlooked, especially in mild cases. Overt and subclinical hyper- and hypothyroidism can both lead to (mostly mild) hypertension; however, the underlying mechanisms are only partially understood. The results of clinical studies are often controversial. During the past decades, some genetic mutations in the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis with cardiovascular consequences were revealed. Atherosclerotic changes resulting from lipid abnormalities due to thyroid dysfunction also affect the vasculature and can cause elevated blood pressure. The review gives a synopsis of our knowledge how thyroid hormone metabolism and functional thyroid diseases affect the cardiovascular system, their negative impact and causative role in the development of hypertension.\n\nKeywords:blood pressure, endocrine, hypertension, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, arterial stiffness, cardiovascular risk, thyroid\n\nHypertension affects 26.4% of the global adult population remaining the leading preventable risk factor for premature death and disability worldwide (1,2). Besides the majority of patients with primary (essential) hypertension, a subgroup of ~10% of patients is affected by secondary hypertension. Among the underlying diseases several are of endocrine origin and thyroidal impairments represent an even smaller percentage of the secondary hypertension cases; their incidence and form of presentation varies with age and studied population (3). Hypertension may be the initial clinical presentation for at least 15 endocrine disorders (4), including overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. The correction of thyroid dysfunction may normalize blood pressure (BP) in most cases, therefore checking thyroid function is essential during the workup for hypertension.\n\nThyroid dysfunction, both hypo- and hyperthyroidism may increase the risk of hypertension (5,6). Hypothyroidism should be considered as a graded phenomenon with a wide variety of clinical conditions from subclinical hypothyroidism to myxedema. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a combination of serum thyrotropin (TSH) above the upper reference limit and normal free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels (7). This definition is only applicable in the absence of other acute or chronic recent or ongoing severe illness, assuming a stable thyroid function weeks or more before the evaluation and a normally functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Overt hypothyroidism is characterized by an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, in combination with reduced circulating fT4 and fT3 levels.\n\nWhile the most common cause of hypothyroidism had been environmental iodine deficiency for centuries, the situation has changed and the population became iodine sufficient or only mildly deficient. Since then, the leading causes of hypothyroidism are chronic autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is 5\u201310 times more common in women than in men, characterized by an increased prevalence with age (8,9). In AITDs the thyroid gland is infiltrated by sensitized T lymphocytes, while circulating thyroid autoantibodies can be detected as a consequence of presumably inherited defect in immune surveillance. Furthermore, hypothyroidism may occur as a consequence of radioiodine or surgical treatment for hyperthyroidism, benign nodular thyroid disease or thyroid cancer, and after external beam radiation for head and neck malignancies. Pharmacological treatment, in most of the cases administration of the iodine-containing antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone, lithium, or immune response modulators, such as interferon alfa can result in the development of thyroiditis and thyroid dysfunction; relatively new iatrogenic causes of hypothyroidism are tyrosine kinase inhibitors and PD-1 inhibitors, sunitinib, and nivolumab, respectively. Sunitinib induces hypothyroidism via reduction of glandular vascularization and induction of type 3 deiodinase enzyme (9,10). The mechanism by which nivolumab impairs the thyroid function is not entirely understood; the explanation might be a reduction in the immune tolerance to normal thyroid tissue antigens (11). Central causes of hypothyroidism are acquired or congenital of origin; pituitary or hypothalamic tumors (including craniopharyngiomas), inflammatory (lymphocytic or granulomatous hypophysitis) or infiltrative diseases, hemorrhagic necrosis (Sheehan's syndrome), or surgical and radiation treatment for pituitary or hypothalamic disease can stay in the background of insufficient production of bioactive TSH (9).\n\nThe reported prevalence rate of overt hypothyroidism is between 0.2 and 5.3% in Europe and 0.3\u20133.7% in the United States, most probably due to the differences in iodine intake (12). The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism was found to be 7.5% in the Wickham study (13), while in the Colorado study 21% among women and 16% in men, respectively (14). The levels of circulating TSH and antithyroid autoantibodies increase with advancing age; according to the NHANES III data TSH levels above 4.5 mIU/L are present in 14% of the population aged 85 and above (8).\n\nThe most common causes of hyperthyroidism are autoimmune Graves' disease and multinodular goiter. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism can be a consequence of iodine exposure during administration of iodine-containing drugs among which far the most important is amiodarone, or excess of levothyroxine replacement therapy. Immune response modulator therapy of cancers can lead to hypo- and less frequently hyperthyroidism (15). Subacute thyroiditis is a less frequent cause of hyperthyroidism. Iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism is the declared aim of T4 therapy, and is a relatively frequent condition among patients with differentiated thyroid cancer after near-total thyroidectomy. Further, a few weeks of iatrogenic overt hypothyroidism is an alternative to recombinant TSH administration before radioiodine treatment and during follow-up, in accordance with international guidelines.\n\nThe prevalence of thyrotoxicosis among women is between 0.5 and 2%, a 10-fold female predominance is present. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a condition of mild thyroid hormone excess defined by a serum TSH concentration below the lower reference limit and normal serum fT4 and fT3 concentrations. The same biochemical pattern may describe hypothalamic or pituitary disease, non-thyroidal illness, or the pharmacologic effect of TSH secretion inhibiting drugs. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism ranges from 0.5 to 6.3%, with the highest established prevalence in individuals over 65 years; approximately half of the affected patients are on levothyroxine substitution (16).\n\nOther relatively common thyroid diseases as multinodular goiter with euthyroidism and differentiated thyroid cancer have sparse impact on the cardiovascular system, and especially, the development of hypertension; however, a recently published meta-analysis found that hypertension significantly increases the risk of development of thyroid cancer (17).\n\nThis review focuses on the common functional thyroid disorders, hypo- and hyperthyroidism that have impact on the cardiovascular system and especially hypertension. The underlying causes of thyroid dysfunction are listed inTable 1.\n\nCauses of thyroid dysfuntions.\n\nTriiodothyronine is the biologically active form of thyroid hormone derived from 5\u2032-monodeiodination of thyroxine in all tissues outside of the thyroid gland, particularly the kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle. The basal metabolic rate is affected by fT3 via altering oxygen consumption, substrate requirements and tissue thermogenesis (4). Thyroid hormones have direct and indirect cellular effects on the cardiovascular system. In hyperthyroidism systemic vascular resistance decreases as fT3 dilates resistance arterioles of the peripheral circulation, which results in the fall of the effective arterial filling followed by stimulation of renin release and activation of the angiotensin-aldosterone axis (18).\n\nPatients with hyperthyroidism present with increased heart rate, increased pulse amplitude, and increased cardiac output by up to 300%, which resembles a state of increased adrenergic activity (6,19), despite normal or low serum concentrations of catecholamines. Other hormonal factors are also affected: the levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, endothelin-1 and the vasodilating polypeptide adrenomedullin are elevated in hyperthyroidism (6,20). Thyroid hormone also stimulates erythropoietin secretion. Furthermore, T3 directly increases cardiac contractility, leading to widened pulse pressure (18,20,21). The coexistence of ischemic or hypertensive heart disease in a thyroid patient may compromise the ability of the myocardium to respond to the increased metabolic needs in hyperthyroidism and demands caution from the clinician (6).\n\nThe mortality of patients with hyperthyroidism was found to be increased by 20%, and the major causes of death are due to cardiovascular origin (22). The level of cardiac T3, as myocyte intracellular deiodinase activity is not significant, is fundamental in maintaining cardiac morphology and function in adult life via genomic and non-genomic effects. The expression of the main structural and regulatory genes is regulated by T3. Positively regulated genes as \u03b1-myosin heavy chain, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase, \u03b21-adrenergic receptor, atrial natriuretic hormone and voltage-gated potassium channels also contribute to the development of cardiac output increase observed in hyperthyroidism (21). In contrary, the inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase phospholamban is negatively regulated, as well as the genes of \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, adenylyl cyclase catalytic subunits, Na+/Ca2+exchanger and thyroid hormone receptor \u03b11 (21). Non-genomic effects of T3 can develop rapidly in the cardiovascular system not requiring thyroid hormone response element-mediated transcriptional events and altering or modulating the effects of genomic mechanisms (23).\n\nAccording to earlier studies heart failure develops in 6\u201316% of patients with hyperthyroidism. Patients with preexisting hypertension or with risk factors for coronary artery disease have a more pronounced risk for developing hemodynamic changes leading to chronic heart failure. A relatively frequent complication of hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, is an independent predictor for the development of chronic heart failure (24,25).\n\nArterial stiffness is increased in hyperthyroidism (26) due to the effect of thyroxin on vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells via genomic and non-genomic action targeting membrane ion channels and endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (27). In addition, the Calcium/ Calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV), which is known to be a major thyroid hormone target gene during brain development, plays an important role in blood pressure regulation through the control of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOC) activity (28\u201330).\n\nThe hemodynamic effects of hypothyroidism are opposite to those of hyperthyroidism, although the clinical manifestations are less obvious with bradycardia being the most common sign accompanied by mild hypertension and a narrowed pulse pressure. Bradycardia, decreased ventricular filling and cardiac contractility together lead to low cardiac output. An increase in the systemic vascular resistance and slowed ventricular diastolic relaxation and filling are present. The decreased metabolic rate leads to a decline in peripheral oxygen demand, consequently heart failure is a rare clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism (31). Elevated diastolic blood pressure is present in ~30% of patients with overt hypothyroidism. Cardiac contractility and output decreases leading to a narrowed pulse pressure. In hypothyroidism renin release is decreased with an increased salt sensitivity. The consequent renal sodium reabsorption leads to an expansion of blood volume by 5.5% (5,21,31).\n\nWe have previously shown that in patients who had undergone thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, increased aortic stiffness and impaired diastolic function can be detected during induced overt hypothyroidism, which is part of the diagnostic follow-up procedure (32).\n\nSeveral clinical data suggest that autoimmune thyroid disease may be responsible for the development of primary pulmonary hypertension in both hyper- and hypothyroidism; therefore in pulmonary hypertension (PH) thyroid function should be evaluated (33,34).\n\nThe effects of the functional thyroid disorders on the cardiovascular system leading to hypertension are summarized inFigure 1.\n\nEffects of functional thyroid disorders on the cardiovascular system leading to hypertension.\n\nWhile a normal TSH and consequently fT4 and fT3 within the physiological range are essential in growth, differentiation and maintenance of adequate function of all human organs, several genetic defects have been evaluated and described in the route of thyroid hormone signaling during the past decade, including those with mutations in thyroid hormone transporters and receptors (35). According to novel studies, even minor changes in the thyroid hormone levels can affect bone mineral density (36), mental status (37), and can also lead to impaired metabolism (38), and increased cardiovascular risk (39). While the levels of the serum thyroid hormones show marked inter-individual variability, there is no significant intra-individual variability, as TSH values change very little during time (40). Based on these results a conclusion can be made that each individual has a unique thyroid set-point, defined by genetic and environmental factors such as iodine intake and smoking (41,42).\n\nThe genetic pattern of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis involves numerous genes with rare high-penetrance variants and common low-penetrance forms, mutations and polymorphisms, respectively. Several mutations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis were described to date and found responsible for impaired thyroid function (43,44). A large number of new genes were identified during the last decade that affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, some of which are responsible for thyroid dysfunction and consequently affect different organs and present risk factors for the development of different diseases, including hypertension.\n\nThyroid dysfunction is rarely attributed to single gene mutations. Numerous studies were performed in the last 2 years to reveal genetic variants presenting with polymorphisms associated with thyroid impairment and altered function. These encompass both linkage and candidate gene analyses targeting the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid pathway. A detailed overview of genes affecting the thyroid axis is found elsewhere (35). A few polymorphisms were found to be associated with blood pressure; however, the results remain controversial. A couple of type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2) gene mutations were found to cause hypertension in middle-aged patients with euthyroidism (45). Interestingly, these variants did not cause any changes in the circulating TSH or free thyroid hormone levels (46,47). These results were not confirmed by other clinical studies (48,49). A mutation in the thyrotropin releasing hormone receptor gene was characterized to be associated with an increased risk of essential high blood pressure (50). The findings regarding gene mutations affecting blood pressure values remain controversial and need further evaluation.\n\nHyperthyroidism is accompanied by cardiovascular complications (cardiac arrhythmias, hypercoagulopathy, stroke, and pulmonary embolism) in a significant number of cases, leading to an increase in short-term morbidity and long-term morbidity and mortality. Brandt et al. found a significant 20% increase in mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism in their meta-analysis based on seven studies (22).\n\nThe excess of T3 leads to metabolic and hemodynamic changes: metabolic rate, cardiac preload, and ventricular contractility increases while systemic vascular resistance decreases, causing an increased cardiac output and hypertension, as discussed above.\n\nThe highest risk of coronary heart disease mortality and atrial fibrillation is noted when serum TSH is below 0.10 mIU/l (51).\n\nHemodynamic changes affect not only the left cardiac output, since pulmonary hypertension may also be present in patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves-disease or nodular goiter (33). Pulmonary hypertension was found to be the most common complication in a study which investigated hyperthyroid patients by echocardiography (52). The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension was detected to be relatively high among hyperthyroid patients, varying between 36 and 65%, although mild and asymptomatic cases were found to be the most common (53,54).\n\nIn the pharmacological treatment of systolic secondary hypertension caused by hyperfunction of the thyroid gland, besides reaching euthyroidism, non-selective beta-blockers are often preferred, for controlling the concomitant tachycardia and tremor effectively and blocking the peripheral T4 to T3 conversion (55).\n\nThe increased cardiovascular mortality among patients with hyperthyroidism may be as well the consequence of shared genetic or environmental factors, based on the pronounced familial aggregation of hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, lifespan, and smoking habits (22).\n\nOur group previously found that there is an increase in the aortic stiffness in combination with decreased diastolic function in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism on levothyroxine suppression therapy after total thyroidectomy due to differentiated thyroid cancer (32).\n\nA study found that patients with hyperthyroidism and normal blood pressure during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) had higher systolic blood pressure than euthyroid normotensive participants. The successful treatment of hyperthyroidism resulted in normalization of systolic blood pressure. The nocturnal decrease in blood pressure did not differ from that of normal subjects (56).\n\nIn a recently published study Lillevang-Johansen et al. investigated the association between hyperthyroidism and the occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) events among treated and untreated hyperthyroid patients (57). The real-world data of this study revealed the impact of varying thyroid status on cardiovascular events: untreated and insufficiently treated hyperthyroid patients had increased cardiovascular risk. According to the data of more than 275,000 individuals followed-up for hyperthyroidism, sufficiently controlled thyrotoxicosis did not increase cardiovascular risk. After an adjustment for main cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, the findings were not significantly affected, suggesting that elevated thyroid hormone levels are playing a major role in the increase of CV risk (57). These findings suggest that careful monitoring of treatment and maintaining euthyroidism is fundamental in the prevention of CV events among patients with hyperthyroidism.\n\nSubclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal serum TSH value accompanied by T4 and T3 within the normal reference range. The change in thyroid function needs to be evaluated and confirmed by a second laboratory measurement after 3\u20136 months (58). The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism can be detected more frequently in iodine depleted areas and increases with advancing age (58). According to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) 0.7% of 16,533 people were reported to have subclinical hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.1 mU/L); these subjects were not taking thyroid medication (8). Subclinical hyperthyroidism can be classified into two categories: Grade 1, with a mild decrease of serum TSH (0.1\u20130.4 mIU/L), and Grade 2, with a more marked TSH decrease (TSH below 0.1 mIU/L) (59).\n\nThe long exposure of the heart to subclinical hyperthyroidism leads to an altered cardiac morphology and function. As a consequence, left ventricular function changes: systolic function is enhanced, while diastolic function becomes impaired, a slowed myocardial relaxation is present resulting in an increase of left ventricular mass (60); as well as increased heart rate and arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (61).\n\nAlthough lipid profile is not affected unfavorably in subclinical hyperthyroidism, endothelial dysfunction and increased thrombogenicity is present (59,62,63).\n\nA meta-analysis with more than 25,000 participants proved that subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease events and coronary artery disease mortality, and also with elevated total mortality. The risk for mortality due to coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation was more prominent in Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism (51).\n\nIn the Rotterdam study involving more than 9,000 participants, the risk of cardiovascular mortality increased in a linear manner with subclinical hyperthyroidism and free T4 levels close to the upper limit of the reference range compared to those with free T4 levels close to the lower limit (64). A large systematic review with data from more than 70,000 people found that subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with an increased risk of total mortality, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease mortality in patients with Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism (65).\n\nBesides these changes in the cardiovascular risk due to subclinical hyperthyroidism, prospective cohort studies failed to show significant association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypertension (66,67). Due to the increased risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases and mortality, there is a wide agreement among specialists that treatment of patients with Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism should be initiated (59).\n\nThyroid hormones affect biochemical and molecular mechanisms of lipid homeostasis resulting in a variable phenomenon of dyslipidemia (68) mostly characterized by high serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and normal or even elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Furthermore, high serum concentrations of triglycerides, intermediate-density lipoproteins, apolipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B are frequently observed (69\u201371). The primary mechanism in the background of hypercholesterolemia is the accumulation of LDL cholesterol due to reduction in the number and activity of the cell-surface LDL receptors resulting in decreased hepatic LDL catabolism. In addition to the direct effect of T3 on the promoter region of the LDL receptor gene, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SERBP-2) gene is also regulated by T3, resulting in the altered transcription of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and LDL receptor genes (68,71,72). Thyroid hormones also increase the activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein, hepatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (56,61). Although a substantial number of studies indicated a beneficial response in patients with TSH levels between 2.5 and 4.5 concerning atherosclerosis risk factors such as atherogenic lipid parameters, impaired endothelial function, and intima media thickness (9,73), TSH has no defined cutoff threshold regarding cardiovascular prevention and atherosclerosis (68).\n\nA study of more than 30,000 patients showed similar results: increased LDL, non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides and decreased HDL with high-normal TSH levels still in the reference range (74). Since the thyroid hormones have known regulatory effect on the lipid metabolism and consequently on blood pressure, their impact on the cardiovascular system may be partially explained by these mechanisms (75,76). Another large prospective study involving more than 14,000 participants with normal TSH levels at start and followed for 11 years found that high-normal TSH levels were predictive for moderately higher blood pressure in the future. Moreover, 1 mU/L elevation in the TSH values resulted in about 2 mmHg elevation in the systolic blood pressure, 1\u20132 mmHg increase in the diastolic blood pressure and 0.1 mmol/L rise in non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride values (77).\n\nHypothyroidism being one of the most common secondary causes of dyslipidemia (78) is clearly associated with an increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease owing to its metabolic and hemodynamic effects (79). Atherosclerosis develops in patients with hypothyroidism as a consequence of multiple mechanisms including hyperlipidemia, hypercoagulable state, endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness which leads to arterial hypertension (80,81).\n\nThe atherogenic lipid changes in hypothyroidism, similarly to the ones in BP values, appear to develop rapidly, as seen in individuals with a hypothyroidism only 3 weeks following thyroidectomy due to non-toxic multinodular goiter (82). Even low normal fT4 concentrations have been associated with a more atherogenic lipid profile (83). In a study involving more than 5,000 participants a significant association has been described between LDL, total cholesterol and TSH levels ranging 3.5\u201310 mU/L (84). Total cholesterol and LDL levels decreased in a crossover study after 100 \u03bcg levothyroxine supplementation of the subjects having TSH values greater than 6.1 mU/L (85). The same result was observed in another study conducted among individually substituted patients with TSH greater than 8 mU/L (68,86).\n\nBesides dyslipidemia, changes in coagulation parameters are described in thyroid disorders being partly responsible for atherogenic changes. Decreased platelet count, aggregation and agglutination, von Willebrand factor antigen and activity, decreased levels of several coagulation factors such as factor VII, VIII, IX, XI, and plasminogen activator-1 can be detected in overt hypothyroidism leading to hypercoagulability. In subclinical hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease increased fibrinogen level, factor VII level and activity, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level have been detected rendering a tendency toward a hypercoagulable state (87,88). The mechanisms underlying the development of the changes in coagulation parameters in hypothyroidism are not well understood. A possible explanation might be the direct effect of the thyroid hormones. However, it is still unclear whether the thyroid hormone deficiency or the elevated TSH levels, or both, are responsible for the alteration in the coagulation parameters (87).\n\nFurthermore, the association between hypothyroidism and defects in the secretion of endothelium-dependent dilation factors is well known (89,90). Endothelial cell TSH receptor induces multiple effects including the down-regulation of anti-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukine-6, in addition to the induction of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), and leukocyte adhesion (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin). Elevated expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules is related to endothelial dysfunction, which is believed to be an early step in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Assessment of endothelial dysfunction, as an early biomarker, is helpful in predicting cardiovascular risk and evaluating the outcome of treatment (91). Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery is a functional test of the capacity of increased blood flow provoked by the release of endothelial NO and other vasodilator mediators, following induced ischemia, therefore, is an accepted early method for non-invasive assessment of systemic endothelial function (92). Flow-mediated dilation was found to be impaired not only in patients with mild hypothyroidism but also in subjects with \u201chigh-normal\u201d serum TSH levels (93). Another study also reported that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism had significantly lower flow-mediated dilation values (94).\n\nDespite the above mentioned data, the association of subclinical hypothyroidism and atherosclerosis is still debated, although hyperlipidemia is usually present (79,95). Carotid artery intima-media thickness measurement remains a long-standing and reliable diagnostic modality used to assess vascular morbidity at an early stage (96). A recent study revealed that carotid artery intima-media thickness is significantly higher in patients with both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism compared with normal control subjects (97).\n\nCentral arterial stiffness is positively associated with systolic hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure, which are the leading causes of mortality in developed countries. Central arterial stiffening or reduced arterial compliance leads to augmented central blood pressure, increased cardiac afterload, and is an independent predictor of cardiac events (98). A previous study confirmed that hypothyroidism is associated with increased augmentation of central aortic pressure and central arterial stiffness. Furthermore, these abnormalities are reversed after adequate T4 replacement (80). Arterial stiffness was also increased in subclinical hypothyroidism and improved with L-thyroxine treatment (99).\n\nThe above detailed impairment in the lipid metabolism due to hypothyroidism may contribute to the development or progression of hypertension. In addition, patients affected by hypothyroidism may have other concomitant cardiovascular diseases and consequently their summed effect on the blood pressure may be even more accentuated.\n\nA high prevalence of diastolic hypertension had been found in patients above 50 years of age with overt hypothyroidism whose blood pressure was normalized after adequate thyroid hormone replacement therapy (100). However, hypothyroidism as a cause of hypertension is often overlooked. In an early study Saito et al. found a 3-fold higher prevalence of diastolic hypertension in hypothyroidism than in age-matched patients without thyroid disorder using the World Health Organization's (WHO) earlier used criteria for hypertension, namely blood pressure > 160/95 mmHg (100,101). According to the current ESC guidelines for the treatment of hypertension, in-office systolic blood pressure (SBP) values \u2265 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values \u2265 90 mmHg define hypertension based on evidence from multiple randomized clinical trials proving that treatment of patients with these BP values is beneficial (102).\n\nMasked hypertension, defined as a normal in-office blood pressure in spite of higher values detected during an active day, can be found during evaluation via ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM); masked hypertension is present in ~15% of untreated patients. The prevalence of this condition is greater among younger men, who are affected by higher levels of anxiety and job stress. Furthermore, habits like smoking, alcohol consumption and more pronounced physical activity are more common among them (103). Recently published data has suggest that many individuals with masked hypertension present with a higher left ventricular mass index, therefore a higher cardiovascular risk, in the detection of which ABPM seems more efficient than HBPM (104). In a recently published pilot study, the occurrence of masked hypertension was evaluated among patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism using 24-h ABPM; a significantly higher prevalence of masked hypertension was found in both groups compared to controls with euthyroidism, which suggests the existence of elevated cardiovascular risk in hypothyroidism, especially in young male patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (105).\n\nPositive association of serum TSH levels with arterial blood pressure was demonstrated through a cross-sectional analysis of pooled data from five population-based studies in adults (106). The association was present in the full range of TSH and even within the reference range, while positive correlation was limited to prevalent hypertension, and not in a 5-year change of blood pressure or incident hypertension (106). In patients who underwent thyroid surgery due to differentiated thyroid cancer and had overt hypothyroidism before radioiodine therapy, an elevation in nocturnal systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure was found; also, an increased number of non-dippers were found among these subjects (107).\n\nHypothyroidism has been generally considered as a cardiovascular risk factor, as discussed above, stressing the need of routine screening for thyroid function especially among female patients with coronary heart disease or patients with known cardiovascular risk factors (108). Subclinical hypothyroidism is a common entity, characterized by elevated TSH-levels and fT4 and fT3 levels in the normal range.\n\nThe association between elevated blood pressure and overt thyroid disorders has been thoroughly investigated and well-established, while the question whether subclinical changes in the thyroid function present potential risk for the development and maintenance of hypertension are still under debate. Some studies detected positive correlations of subclinical hypothyroidism and hypertension in women (109,110); however, the same results were not confirmed in men (110,111). A number of clinical studies assessed the relationship between subclinical thyroid dysfunction, both hypo and hyperthyroidism, and endothelial dysfunction (112), arterial wall thickening (80,99,113), atrial fibrillation (114), and left ventricular hypertrophy (115). A study involving more than 10.000 children and adolescents found a positive correlation between elevated serum TSH levels and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure; however, this correlation was not established with hypertension (116). Upon these findings, one can presume an association between subclinical hypothyroidism and elevated risk for the development of hypertension.\n\nIn a large, population-based study with more than 30,000 participants the thyrotropin levels within the normal range were significantly correlated with the arterial blood pressure and hypertension as well in both genders; however, TSH levels above the upper limit presented positive association in women only (109). One possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that TSH levels were measured only in half of the male participants and 100% of female patients. Furthermore, these inconsistent data may also be affected by the iodine intake of the studied population; the range of TSH level may differ upon the iodine supply of the studied region (117). Studies that were conducted in regions with iodine excess like Far East Asia failed to find any correlation between blood pressure and TSH values within the normal range; these regions have higher thyrotropin reference range limits (110,118). On the contrary, several studies performed in regions characterized by mild to moderate iodine deficiency or even sufficient iodine intake showed a positive correlation between TSH level and blood pressure values (106,119). The differences observed in the results, however, may be partially due to the higher prevalence of hypertension in Far East Asia compared to Europe and the alternate screening and treatment methods used in these regions (120).\n\nOverall, the data from several studies and pooled analyses suggest that the correlation between high serum thyrotropin levels and blood pressure changes might be time-dependent and cannot predict the further development of hypertension and might occur only during an actual TSH elevation (106).\n\nIn a recently published meta-analysis the effect of levothyroxine replacement therapy on blood pressure in subclinical hypothyroidism was investigated. The summed results of 10 randomized clinical trials showed that after levothyroxine therapy systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly. A subgroup analysis suggested that the systolic blood pressure lowering effect was more accentuated in patients with higher TSH levels. In 19 prospective follow-up studies both systolic and diastolic blood pressure values decreased significantly after levothyroxine initiation (121).\n\nAlterations of thyroid function may result in changes in blood pressure values as well as other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, leading to an increased cardiovascular risk, which is mild in most cases, although hyperthyroidism represents a significant elevation of cardiovascular mortality risk. The delayed clinical recognition of subclinical forms of thyroid dysfunction, i.e., subclinical hypo and hyperthyroidism has unfavorable cardiovascular effects. Available data suggest that, concerning cardiovascular risks, early diagnosis, and treatment of even mild forms of functional thyroid disorders might be beneficial in the vast majority of the patients. However, overtreatment should be avoided, and age-related or individual variances of pituitary-thyroid set-points have to be respected.\n\nAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication.\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\nFunding.This research was supported by GINOP-2.3.2-15-2016-00005 project.

Several kidney diseases may cause secondary hypertension, including:\n\nRenovascular hypertension.This type of high blood pressure is caused by narrowing (stenosis) of one or both arteries leading to the kidneys.\n\nRenovascular hypertension is often caused by the same type of fatty plaques that can damage the coronary arteries (atherosclerosis) or a separate condition in which the muscle and fibrous tissues of the renal artery wall thicken and harden into rings (fibromuscular dysplasia).\n\nMedical conditions affecting hormone levels also may cause secondary hypertension. These conditions include:\n\nOther possible causes of secondary hypertension include:\n\nSleep apnea.In this condition, often marked by severe snoring, breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep, causing a lack of oxygen.\n\nNot getting enough oxygen may damage the lining of the blood vessel walls, which may make it harder for the blood vessels to control blood pressure. Also, sleep apnea causes part of the nervous system to be overactive and release certain chemicals that increase blood pressure.\n\nObesity.As body weight increases, the amount of blood flowing through the body increases. This increase in blood flow puts added pressure on artery walls, increasing blood pressure.\n\nBeing overweight also increases the heart rate and makes it harder for the blood vessels to move blood. In addition, fat deposits can release chemicals that raise blood pressure.\n\nMedications and supplements.Various prescription medications \u2014 such as pain relievers, birth control pills, antidepressants and drugs used after organ transplants \u2014 can cause or worsen high blood pressure in some people.\n\nSome decongestants and herbal supplements, including ginseng, licorice and ephedra (ma-huang), may have the same effect.

In fact, if you havetype 1 diabetes,type 2 diabetes,insulin resistance, ormetabolic syndrome, your risk of developing thyroid disease is increased.\n\nOn the flip side, thyroid disease increases your risk of developing metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes. The association is even stronger if you are overweight or obese.\n\nAbnormal thyroid function can alter how your body responds to insulin. An underactive thyroid may even contribute to low blood sugar levels.\n\nThis article helps explain how thyroid disease and diabetes are related. It also offers insights on how to avoid diabetes if you have thyroid disease and vice versa.\n\nThethyroid gland, the butterfly-shaped organ at the base of the neck, plays a major role in regulating many of your body's functions, includingmetabolism(how your body uses energy).\n\nBecause thyroid disease interferes with metabolism, blood sugar (glucose) that would otherwise be used for energy can instead start to accumulate. This increases your risk of diabetes, and it makes it harder to manage your blood sugar if you already have diabetes.\n\nHyperthyroidism(an overactive thyroid) is closely linked withhyperglycemia(high blood sugar).\n\nHyperglycemia caused by thyroid disease can also contribute to metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of five conditions\u2014high glucose,high blood pressure, hightriglycerides, lowHDL cholesterol, and a large waist\u2014that increases the risk of heart disease, diabetes, and stroke.\n\nUntreated metabolic syndrome can progress to type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe thyroid gland helps regulate metabolism (the conversion of food to energy). Thyroid disease can disrupt metabolism, allowing blood sugar levels to rise. High blood sugar levels increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nThyroid disease can also interfere with the production ofinsulin. Insulin makes it possible for cells to use glucose for energy. This lowers blood sugar.\n\nHyperthyroidism can contribute to insulin resistance.When you become resistant to insulin, your cells aren't able to use the glucose in your blood. As a result, blood glucose levels stay high. People with diabetes who needinsulin shotsmay also find themselves needing higher doses.\n\nOn the flip side,hypothyroidism(an underactive thyroid) decreases metabolism. When this happens, insulin can linger, causing blood sugar to drop (hypoglycemia). For people ondiabetes medications, the drop can sometimes be extreme, leading to dizziness, disorientation, and unconsciousness.\n\nThyroid disease can affect insulin levels. Hyperthyroidism can cause blood sugar levels to rise. This can increase the risk of diabetes or make diabetes harder to control. Hypothyroidism can lead to low blood sugar.\n\nIn addition to problems with glucose metabolism and insulin production, there are several other links between thyroid disease and diabetes.\n\nType 1 diabetes is anautoimmune diseasein which the immune system attacks the cells that make insulin. There are certain forms of thyroid disease, calledHashimoto's thyroiditisandGraves' disease, that are also autoimmune.\n\nHashimoto's thyroiditis is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States. Studies suggest that most people with type 1 diabetes will eventually develop Hashimoto's disease.\n\nHaving low thyroid hormones could make you crave sugar and other foods. There are several reports of people with Hashimoto's thyroiditis who had cravings for carbohydrate-rich foods. Eliminating sugar-sweetened beverages and ultra-processed foods is encouraged in these cases.\n\nGraves' disease, on the other hand, causes hyperthyroidism. Around 10% of people with type 1 diabetes will develop Graves' disease.\n\nThehypothalamusof the brain, thepituitary gland, and theadrenal glandswork together, referred to as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA axis). These organs send signals back and forth to each other and together control the body's response to stress. They do this by adjusting levels of the stress hormonecortisol. The HPA axis influences both thyroid hormones and insulin levels.\n\nProblems with any of the organs in the HPA axis can affect how much or how little cortisol is produced. High cortisol levels can lead to hyperglycemia. Low cortisol levels can lead to hypoglycemia.\n\nType 1 diabetes, an autoimmune form of diabetes, often occurs alongside autoimmune thyroid disease. Problems with the HPA axis, which produces the stress hormone cortisol, can lead to abnormal insulin and thyroid hormone levels.\n\nIf you have been diagnosed with either thyroid disease or diabetes, achieving and maintaining your ideal weight is one of the best ways to prevent the other condition. Keeping your blood sugar or thyroid hormones under control can also help.\n\nIf you haveinsulin resistance, in which the body doesn't respond to insulin as it should, thyroid disease can make your blood sugar harder to control. By managing insulin resistance with medications, diet, and exercise, you may be able to avoid diabetes as well as complications of thyroid disease.\n\nBy managing hyperthyroidism with medications, diet, and exercise, you may also reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nIf you have diabetes or thyroid disease, maintaining an ideal weight may help you avoid getting the other condition. Properly managing your blood sugar or thyroid hormone can also help.\n\nDiabetes and thyroid disease are closely linked. If you have hyperthyroidism, your insulin levels can drop and your blood sugar can rise, increasing the risk of diabetes. If you have hypothyroidism, the opposite can occur and lead to bouts of low blood sugar.\n\nOn the flip side, type 1 diabetes (an autoimmune form of diabetes) can increase the risk of Hashimoto's thyroiditis and Graves' disease (autoimmune forms of thyroid disease). Problems with the HPA axis, a group of organs that produce the stress hormone cortisol, can also have a negative effect on insulin and thyroid hormone levels.\n\nIf you have diabetes or thyroid disease, properly managing your condition and maintaining an ideal weight may reduce your risk of developing the other condition.\n\nWang C.The relationship between type 2 diabetes mellitus and related thyroid diseases.J Diabetes Res. 2013;2013:390534. doi:10.1155/2013/390534\n\nEom YS, Wilson JR, Bernet VJ.Links between thyroid disorders and glucose homeostasis.Diabetes Metab J. 2022;46(2):239-256. doi:10.4093/dmj.2022.0013\n\nMullur R, Liu YY, Brent GA.Thyroid hormone regulation of metabolism.Physiol Rev. 2014;94(2):355\u2013382. doi:10.1152/physrev.00030.2013\n\nNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.Metabolic syndrome.\n\nKalra S, Unnikrishnan AG, Sahay R.The hypoglycemic side of hypothyroidism.Indian J Endocrinol Metab. 2014;18(1):1\u20133. doi:10.4103/2230-8210.126517\n\nFleiner HF, Bj\u00f8ro T, Midthjell K, Grill V, \u00c5svold BO.Prevalence of thyroid dysfunction in autoimmune and type 2 diabetes: the population-based HUNT study in Norway.J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 2016;101(2):669-77. doi:10.1210/jc.2015-3235\n\nAbbott RD, Sadowski A, Alt AG.Efficacy of the autoimmune protocol diet as part of a multi-disciplinary, supported lifestyle intervention for Hashimoto's thyroiditis.Cureus. 2019;11(4):e4556. doi:10.7759/cureus.4556\n\nJonsdottir B,\u00a0Larsson C,\u00a0Carlsson A, et al.Thyroid\u00a0and islet autoantibodies predict autoimmune\u00a0thyroid disease\u00a0at type 1 diabetes diagnosis.J Clin Endocrinol Metab.\u00a02017 Apr 1;102(4):1277-1285. doi:10.1210/jc.2016-2335\n\nR\u0103c\u0103t\u0103ianu N,\u00a0Leach N,\u00a0Bondor CI,\u00a0et al.Thyroid\u00a0disorders in obese patients.

    "full_text": "Diabetes and thyroid disorders occur due to hormonal changes. Although growing evidence suggests a link between diabetes and thyroid disorders, researchers are currently unsure what connects them.\n\nThyroid disorders and diabetes are two of the most common conditions that endocrinologists treat. An \u201cendocrine disorder\u201d is any condition that affects the production and release of hormones.\n\nPeople living with diabetes may be at a higher risk of developing a thyroid disorder and vice versa.\n\nThis article will discuss the relationship between diabetes and thyroid disorders in more detail.\n\nExperts refer to both diabetes and thyroid disorders as endocrine disorders.\n\nThis term refers to medical conditions in which theendocrine system, which produces hormones,cannotfunction correctly. These conditions can have several potential causes, and because they affect hormones, they can lead to a wide range of symptoms.\n\nThe endocrine systemconsistsof eight major glands throughout the body, including thethyroidandpancreas.\n\nThe thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland that sits at the front of the neck. It produces hormones, such asthyroxine (T4)andtriiodothyronine (T3), which help regulate body processes. These processes include the following:\n\nIn some cases, the thyroid may overproduce hormones, causing a condition calledhyperthyroidism.\n\nIt can also underproduce hormones, leading to a condition calledhypothyroidism.\n\nAutoimmune conditionscan often result in the development of these thyroid disorders.Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditisandGraves\u2019 diseaseare common causes of hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism, respectively.\n\nThe pancreas is a gland in the abdomen that plays a role in the digestive system. It producesinsulin, a hormone that helps blood sugar, also called glucose, enter cells, providing the cells and body with essential energy. Without enough insulin, a person may develop diabetes.\n\nDiabetes affects the body\u2019s ability to process blood glucose. There are multiple types of diabetes, withtype 1andtype 2being the most common.\n\nIn type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly attacks the pancreas, reducing insulin production.\n\nMany variables may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes, such as:\n\nThe thyroid secretes hormones that regulate a person\u2019s metabolism. An imbalance in these hormonescan affectblood sugar in several ways.\n\nExcess thyroid hormone increases a metabolic process called lipolysis, which involves the breakdown of body fat into serum-free fatty acids, and the secretion of insulin andglucagon. The sum of these effects causes glucose metabolism to worsen, which can cause glucose intolerance and diabetes.\n\nGlucagon is a hormone that the pancreasreleaseswhen a person experienceshypoglycemia, a condition in which their blood sugar levels are too low. The body stops releasing glucagon when the blood sugar levels return to ahealthy range.\n\nAccording to a 2016 review, an excess of glucagon is thekey factorin the development of diabetes.\n\n\u201cLiving with diabetes and a thyroid disorder has been tough, but I manage them carefully with support. For diabetes, I watch my diet, check my blood sugar, and stay active. I also take medication and see my endocrinologist regularly for my thyroid.\n\nIt\u2019s intriguing how diabetes and thyroid problems are linked. They both involve the endocrine system. People with diabetes often have thyroid issues, and vice versa. So, I closely monitor both conditions and ensure my doctors know my full medical history.\n\nManaging both conditions means living a healthy lifestyle and getting specialized care. Following my treatment plan helps me stay healthier and improves my quality of life.\u201d\n\nEvidencesuggests a link between insulin resistance and both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Because thyroid hormones are essential for carbohydrate metabolism, thyroid dysfunctioncan affectinsulin and lead to the development oftype 2 diabetes.\n\nInsulin resistance may occur due to hyperthyroidism because of an increase in fatty free acids in the bloodstream. In body fat, the thyroid hormone stimulates lipolysis, the breakdown of body fat into fatty acids.\n\nResearchsuggests there is a link between the levels of serum-free fatty acids and diabetes because these fatty acids can hinder insulin secretion and cause insulin resistance.\n\nA2017 reviewfound a link between insulin resistance and even small increases in thethyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which tends to be high in hypothyroidism.Researchsuggests the association between hypothyroidism and insulin resistance may be partially due to insulin\u2019s decreased ability to increase glucose utilization in muscle tissue.\n\nBecause hypothyroidism can slow themetabolism, insulin stays in the bloodstream longer. This suggests a person with diabetes and hypothyroidism may require a lower dose of insulin for their treatment.\n\nSome forms of thyroid disorders are autoimmune conditions.Researchsuggests a close association between the autoimmune response that causes type 1 diabetes and autoimmune-induced thyroid dysfunction (AITD).\n\nAn estimated 17\u201330% of adults with type 1 diabetesalso haveAITD. Additionally, 25% of children with type 1 diabetes have autoimmune hypothyroidism.Researchsuggests that genetic factors may contribute to this.\n\nThe hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which is the interaction of thehypothalamus, pituitary gland, andadrenal glands, may beanother possible linkbetween diabetes and the thyroid.\n\nThese glands secrete hormones into the blood and help manage reactions to stress by regulating levels of the hormonecortisol. Too much cortisol can increase a person\u2019s glucose levels by stimulating the liver to increase new glucose formation, causing a state of insulin resistance and a decrease in insulin secretion.\n\nAs such, problems with the HPA axis can lead to atypical blood sugar levels and affect the body\u2019s response to insulin.\n\nIn many cases, it may not be possible to prevent diabetes or thyroid disorders.\n\nAt present, there is no guaranteed way to prevent an autoimmune disease from developing. However, a person may be able to prevent or delay the onset of conditions that do not have genetic causes.\n\nTheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionsuggests it is possible to prevent type 2 diabetes by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly, and losing excess weight if needed.\n\nTo help manage diabetes, a person can create a diabetes self-care plan, whichmay include:\n\nTreatment for thyroid disorders will depend on whether the thyroid gland is underactive or overactive.\n\nWhile there is currently no cure for hypothyroidism, a personcan manageit with medication. By taking T4 replacements, a person can increase their T4 and return their TSH to a healthy level.\n\nSome treatment options are available to help manage hyperthyroidism,including:\n\nA doctor may also advise individuals currently living with either diabetes or a thyroid disorder to receive regular screenings for the other condition. For example, some evidence suggests it may be beneficial to offer screening for a thyroid disorder to people living withtype 1ortype 2diabetes.\n\nAnyone who suspects they might have diabetes or a thyroid dysfunction should contact a doctor to receive a diagnosis and treatment if needed.\n\nCommon symptoms of diabetes include:\n\nSymptoms of hypothyroidism can include having dry skin and feeling cold and tired.\n\nWith hyperthyroidism, a person may experience the following:\n\nIt is also best for people to contact a doctor if they are already living with either diabetes or a thyroid disorder and suspect they might also have the other condition.\n\nData from a2020 studyon the relationship between diabetes and thyroid dysfunction suggests it is best for people with any type of diabetes to receive routine tests for thyroid dysfunction.\n\nVisit our dedicated hub for more research-backed information and in-depth resources ondiabetes.\n\nEvidence suggests a close link between thyroid disorders and diabetes. Thyroid dysfunction can affect a person\u2019s insulin and blood sugar levels, which can contribute to the development of diabetes.\n\nBoth underactive and overactive thyroid disorders are more common in people who have diabetes than those who do not have diabetes. It is best for a person who is concerned about either condition to contact a doctor."

    "full_text": "In the past years, Confocal Raman Microscopy (CRM) has gained great interest as characterization technique for biological materials due to the high lateral resolution [\n\n]. Depending on the numerical aperture of the objective and the excitation wavelength of the laser, a CRM set up can reach a spatial resolution down to 250\u00a0nm [\n\n,\n\n]. The advantages of CRM are many since one can acquire a chemical profile of the sample in a non-destructive and fast way, without time consuming sample preparation and staining. The coupling of rapid high sensitivity detectors and the xyz-driven piezo scan tables with high precision have allowed CRM to become suitable for Raman imaging i.e. chemical spatially resolved profiling. This is very important when analysing heterogeneous systems like biological samples.\n\nPlant cell walls make the skeleton of the plant body and differ in their chemical and structural properties depending on species, age, environmental conditions and also position within the same tree/plant [\n\n\u2013\n\n]. The potential of CRM has been shown in many studies by revealing the spatial distribution of lignin [\n\n,\n\n] and other aromatic substances [\n\n], the location of carbohydrates as pectin [\n\n,\n\n], the orientation of cellulose in the cell wall [\n\n], conformational changes of proteins [\n\n], the accumulation of fats and waxes of the plant cuticle [\n\n,\n\n] and also minerals [\n\n,\n\n]. An extensive practical guide on Raman imaging of plant cell walls can be found in [\n\n]. Specific band integration of different functional groups serves always as a first univariate approach and visualizes approximately component distributions [\n\n]. In Raman spectra of plant cells, many of the bands are not sufficiently sharp and clearly separated and attributable to a specific functional group of only one plant cell wall component. Instead, they are often broad and overlapping. The overlapping bands of different components and the large amount of data in an image scan are often a limiting factor for classical univariate approaches and can be overcome using multivariate data analysis. Over the years, the most recurrent methods in multivariate image analysis have been Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [\n\n] and cluster analysis (hierarchical or k-means clustering) [\n\n]. PCA aims at the optimal description of the relevant variance in the original data set through a bilinear model based on principal components, i.e. uncorrelated variables calculated to capture the directions of maximum variance of the data set. PCA models allow performing a reduction in the dimensionality of the original data set, remove random noise and display relevant information about the pixel and spectral space of the image [\n\n]. However, small variations that do not contribute to main fluctuations in the spectroscopic signal, e.g. different molecular structures of the same molecule, different orientations or different steps in a molecular pathway, can be eventually masked if an insufficient number of principal components is used. Cluster analysis by contrast is a segmentation algorithm oriented to find groups of pixels with similar spectra, i.e. with similar chemical composition, but finding the right number of clusters is also complex [\n\n].\n\nSpectral unmixing algorithms also describe images through a bilinear model analogous to the Beer\u2013Lambert law [\n\n], but they define the necessary components using \u201cbiological\u201d meaningful constraints i.e. non-negativity and others, instead of orthogonality. The basic model of any spectral unmixing algorithm is described as follows:\n\nwhere\n\n(sized\n\n\u00d7\n\n) is the original data set that contains all the pixel (spectra) of the image,\n\nis the matrix of concentration profiles or coefficients (sized\n\n\u00d7\n\n) and\n\nis the named pure spectra, or dictionary matrix\n\nsized\n\n\u00d7\n\nelements), that contains the profiles of the pure components as a result of the unmixing process.\n\ncontains the related concentration profiles (or abundances) of each pure spectral contribution (\n\n) in the different pixels. The denomination and characters used to describe the matrices in the bilinear model in Eq.\n\nmay change among unmixing methods, but not the underlying model. Each pixel spectrum in a hyperspectral image formed by positive spectral features is in all approaches explained by a linear combination of the pure endmember spectra forced to positive values (non-negativity constraint). They are weighted by a set of positive coefficients, which design the abundance of each pure endmember signature in the reconstruction of each particular pixel spectrum [\n\n]. There are several unmixing methods applicable to spectroscopy but also to other fields [\n\n,\n\n]. Among them, Vertex Component Analysis (VCA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) have become quite popular.\n\nThe VCA algorithm has been used in monitoring cellular uptake [\n\n], in depicting the distribution of amygdalin in apricot seeds [\n\n], in giving insights into the plant cell wall structure [\n\n], in the selection of marker spectra of hyperspectral images of leafs in order to determine the pigment content [\n\n] or in unmixing optoacoustic data [\n\n]. VCA assumes that all pixels in the image are in a space (simplex of a determined order depending on the number of endmembers) defined by the purest components (vertices) called endmembers (EM) and that the affine transformation of a simplex is also a simplex. VCA has low computational complexity and needs the presence of pure pixels in the data to ensure the recovery of the correct endmembers. The data are projected orthogonally into the space given by the spanned endmembers. After each step, the extreme of the projection corresponds to the new endmember signature until the number of endmembers is exhausted. The sequential projections are made in such a way that the endmembers recovered are positive and the sum of abundances of compounds in every pixel equals one [\n\n].\n\nNMF has been successfully used in deciphering the complexity of samples in different fields including time resolved optical waveguide absorption spectroscopy [\n\n], astronomical spectroscopy data [\n\n], chemical agent detection by Raman spectroscopy [\n\n], fluorescence spectroscopy [\n\n], nuclear magnetic resonance data [\n\n], text mining [\n\n], facial recognition [\n\n], gene expression analysis [\n\n] and unsupervised audio-visual document structuring [\n\n]. In addition, NMF has also shown its potential in resolving spectra of Raman images of the plant cell wall [\n\n]. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) describes the original matrix of spectral data through a bilinear model of non-negative constituent factors [\n\n]. Some NMF implementations contain the sparseness condition as an additional constraint [\n\n,\n\n]. NMF is an iterative algorithm that combines the endmember spectra in order to reproduce the original data set as accurately as possible, i.e. providing models with an explained variance as high as possible. The number of components needed (or rank) is defined by the user trying to establish a compromise between good data approximation (high rank) and low model complexity (small rank). The quality of the approximation of the product of the decomposed matrices\n\nand\n\nto give the original matrix\n\ncan be monitored by a cost function which can be the Euclidean distance between the single elements of\n\nand the reproduced elements by the\n\nmodel [\n\n,\n\n]. In contrast to VCA, the optimization of all endmembers is made simultaneously. The implementation of the NMF algorithm used in this work can also handle the presence of missing values in\n\n.\n\nMCR-ALS is an unmixing algorithm used in many diverse fields, such as image analysis [\n\n], environmental analysis [\n\n], protein processes [\n\n] and\u2014omics sciences [\n\n], but also on Raman data of plants [\n\n]. MCR-ALS is an iterative algorithm that optimizes\n\nand\n\nin an alternating least-squares way under constraints that provide chemically meaningful profiles [\n\n\u2013\n\n]. As for NMF, all components in the model are optimized simultaneously and the MCR model aims at describing the maximum variance of the original data set. The advantage of MCR-ALS is that multiple constraints can be added to the analysis. In image analysis, apart from non-negativity, the use of reference spectra, the incorporation of information of presence/absence of components in pixels (local rank constraints, [\n\n]) and, recently, constraints that may improve the description of spatial patterns in maps [\n\n,\n\n], can be taken into account. The number of components to be included in an MCR-ALS model can be decided by the user or be estimated by an auxiliary rank analysis method, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The MCR-ALS optimization of\n\nand\n\nis most often controlled by comparing the data reproduced by the\n\nmodel with a noise-filtered matrix\n\n, obtained from a PCA model using the same number of components as the MCR model. However, the use of this PCA-filtered matrix can be avoided and the MCR model can be optimized by comparing the\n\nmodel with the original experimental data. Usually, the PCA-filtering step is convenient because the removal of noise stabilizes the optimization process. However, in very few instances, where very minor components have to be retrieved or when the spectral overlap is extremely high among some components, the PCA filtering step may present the risk of excluding some relevant information that represents a very low percent of variance [\n\n]. Hence, it may be interesting using the algorithm with and without incorporating the PCA filtering step. Furthermore, the implementation of multiset analysis is also an option when having several related data sets and allows for the simultaneous analysis of all information of interest [\n\n]. In image analysis, MCR-ALS results can be used a posteriori as seeding information for other chemometric tools, such as segmentation methods, [\n\n], calibration tasks [\n\n] or super-resolution approaches [\n\n].\n\nIn this manuscript we have investigated the applicability of the three different multivariate approaches, namely VCA, NMF and MCR-ALS (with and without PCA filtering) for unsupervised unmixing (resolution) of Raman spectra acquired from different plant tissues and species. Raman mappings of microsections of spruce wood (\n\nL. Karst.) Spruce and\n\nhave been studied to include more homogenous tissues (wood) with secondary cell walls as well as different tissues and cell wall types (parenchyma, xylem), respectively. The aim was to compare the potential of the different algorithms, work out the influence of pre-processing (especially baseline correction) and the effect of the selection of other algorithm-specific input parameters.\n\nA 90\u00a0years old Spruce tree (\n\n(L.) Karst.) was harvested in the middle of July 2015 in M\u00fchlviertel (Upper Austria). The bark of the fresh stems was removed immediately to avoid diffusion of bark compounds into the cambium and wood cells, which may enhance burning of the sample during the Raman measurement (personal observation). Pieces were cut out of a stem disc from 130\u00a0cm above ground (breast height) comprising the transition zone between sapwood and heartwood (see Fig.\n\na). The blocks were trimmed and cut in 20\u00a0\u00b5m thick cross sections using a rotary microtome (RM2235, Leica Biosystems Nussloch Gmbh, Germany). The stem of a 30\u00a0cm tall wild type\n\n(see Fig.\n\nb) was embedded in polyethylenglycol (PEG 2000, Sigma Aldrich, Austria) following the protocol described in [\n\n] and cut in 3\u00a0\u00b5m thick sections. Afterwards, the embedding media was washed out thoroughly with Millipore water. The microsections were put on glass slides with a drop of water, covered with glass coverslips (0.17\u00a0mm thick) and sealed with nail polish, to avoid water evaporation during the Raman experiment.\n\nAnatomy of the samples from which the Raman datasets were generated.\n\nLeft: Disk cut from the stem of Spruce. Right: The zoom in the stem is based on the CH stretching integration Raman image of an annual ring with early\u2014(EW) and latewood (LW).\n\nLeft: Schema of the grown plant\n\n. On the right part, a CH stretching integration Raman image of a microsection of the stem is shown and the main anatomical parts are pointed out: xylem, cambium, phloem and pith\n\nRaman spectra from the native cross sections were acquired using a confocal Raman microscope (alpha300RA, WITec GmbH, Germany) with a 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009oil immersion objective (numerical aperture (NA)\u2009=\u20091.4, coverslip correction 0.17\u00a0mm) (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The samples were excited with a linear polarized (0\u00b0) coherent compass sapphire green laser \u03bb\n\n=\u2009532\u00a0nm (WITec, Germany). The scattered Raman signal was collected with an optic multifiber (50\u00a0\u00b5m diameter) to a spectrometer (UHTS 300 WITec, Germany) (600\u00a0g\u00a0mm\n\ngrating, spectral resolution about 3.8\u00a0cm\n\n, maximum and minimum error of about 4.8 and 2.9\u00a0cm\n\n, respectively) and finally detected by the CCD camera (Andor DU401 BV, Belfast, North Ireland). The maximum spatial resolution is given by r\u2009=\u20090.61\u03bb/NA, which for the parameters and confocal set up used is about 230\u00a0nm. The Control Four (WITec, Germany) acquisition software was used for the Raman imaging set up. For both samples, the laser power was set at 36 mW. For Spruce, an integration time of 0.13\u00a0s was used and one spectrum was taken every 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m. For\n\none spectrum was recorded every 0.3\u00a0\u00b5m and the integration time set to 0.18\u00a0s.\n\nData preprocessing was performed using the WITec Project Plus 4.0 software (WITec, Germany). Cosmic ray removal was carried out before any further analysis based on an intensity threshold set by taking into account spectral and spatial pixels adjacent to the pixel of interest. All spectra were cut to the spectral region from 300 to 1800\u00a0cm\n\nbefore background subtraction and multivariate data analysis.\n\nIn order to assess the influence of the background subtraction on the unmixing algorithm output, analyses were done for both datasets with and without previous background correction (based on fitting a polynomial of order 3 and performed in the WITec Project Plus 4.0 software). For Spruce, a rank of 4 endmembers with and without background subtraction was taken for all methods, whereas when 5EM were applied, only the comparison for background subtracted data is shown. For Arabidopsis, the results are discussed with and without background subtraction based on the VCA analysis. The comparison of all approaches on the Arabidopsis dataset is based on the data without background subtraction.\n\nDuring the last 4\u00a0years more than 10 different spruce and Arabidopsis samples have been measured and analysed beside many other different plant species. Thereof two Raman images have been chosen as the most representative and illustrative to show and verify the observed trends in performance of the algorithms and effects of pre-processing and number of endmembers.\n\nAll algorithms were tested with different number of endmembers and with and without background subtraction. The algorithm VCA was applied using the software Cytospec (v.2.00.01). Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was carried out using the WITecPlus 4.1 Software. The number of iterations was selected based on the retrieval of stable results, being for both datasets a minimum of 100,000 iterations. Multivariate Curve Resolution-package GUI 2.0 for MatLab (MathWorks, USA) was used for all MCR-ALS analyses [\n\n]. In order to keep the parameters between methods as similar as possible, for MCR-ALS, non-negativity was used as a constraint in the concentration and spectral direction. Spectral signatures in\n\nwere normalized according to the Euclidean norm. The effect of a prior PCA filtering step was tested in the final MCR-ALS results for both data sets.\n\nTo compare analogous endmembers between different methods they were sorted according to the abundance map and endmember spectra similarity. Additionally, for control, the correlation coefficients between the endmember spectra given by VCA and all the endmembers of the other three methods were calculated.\n\nFor all methods and conditions, the lack of fit (LOF) of the model and the variance explained (r\n\n) by the model was calculated as done in [\n\n]. The expressions used are described below:\n\nwhere\n\nis the element of the original data matrix in row\n\nand column\n\nand\n\nis the residual obtained from the difference between the element\n\nof the original data set and the analogous element reproduced using the suitable unmixing model.\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient between pairs of spectral endmembers was calculated within a method to ensure that the correct number of endmembers was used (too high correlation coefficients could imply an unnecessarily high number of components). Correlation coefficients were also calculated between endmembers obtained with different unmixing methods to facilitate the intermethod endmember correspondence. The statistical analysis was conducted under MatLab environment (MathWorks, USA).\n\nA Raman image of Spruce, comprising earlywood and latewood (Fig.\n\na), was chosen to perform a first assessment of the performance of the three different multivariate methods on blind spectral resolution. All algorithms were first compared based on the results of non-background corrected spectra and 4 endmembers (EM) in the bilinear model (Figs.\n\n,\n\n). The abundance maps given by all methods (Fig.\n\n) recompose the wood tissue as the zones between the cells (cell corners and compound middle lamella with EM1 and EM2, respectively), the cell wall (EM3) and the cell lumen and/or cell wall (EM4). EM2 and EM3 are virtually identical for the three methods [abundances (Fig.\n\n) and spectra (Fig.\n\n)]. EM2 spectra reflect almost pure lignin (e.g. bands at 1600, 1660 and 1140\u00a0cm\n\n) [\n\n\u2013\n\n] between the cells and EM3 a mixture of lignin (see bands before) and polysaccharides (e.g. bands at 1121, 1095 and 380\u00a0cm\n\n[\n\n]), in the cell wall (Fig.\n\n). EM1 and EM4 are more different between the three methods. EM1 includes only the cell corner region in VCA (while in EM2 more compound middle lamella, Fig.\n\n, first row), and the endmember spectrum reflects again clear lignin bands (Fig.\n\n, EM1 red spectrum). The 4th endmember clearly reflects the lumen (Fig.\n\n). So VCA abundance maps reflect the most different regions compared to the other methods (Fig.\n\n), although correlation coefficients between endmember spectra are high (Additional file\n\n: Table S1A). For all other three methods these two endmembers are present at more than one region, EM1 in cell corner and compound middle lamella and EM4 in lumen and cell wall (Fig.\n\n). The distinction of the compound middle lamella in x-direction by the other methods in EM1 is reflected in the spectra by a band around 1095\u00a0cm\n\n(Fig.\n\n), known to be sensitive for cellulose orientation and high in the cell wall layer S1 and compound middle lamella in laser polarisation direction [\n\n]. EM4 abundance maps include in all approaches the lumen, although in different scale (white to dark grey) but in NMF and MCR approaches also the secondary cell wall (Fig.\n\n). All EM4 spectra have low intensity spectra and in MCR-ALS also intensity minima, which appear like inverted bands. This is reflected in a high negative correlation with EM1 (Additional file\n\n: Table S1A). In the case of NMF, neither the abundance map nor the spectrum are interpretable for EM4. Therefore, it seems that for NMF and MCR-ALS approaches either the rank is still too low or a baseline correction is needed to clarify the results, although the models explain 99.99% of variance and have a low lack of fit (0.92\u20133%) (Table\n\n). On the contrary VCA model statistics are inferior, but abundance maps and endmember spectra are sound and interpretable.\n\nUnmixing methods on early and latewood of Spruce without background subtraction and based on 4 endmembers.

The spectra are normalized against the main aromatic band at 1600\u00a0cm\n\nexcept for EM1 and EM4\n\nSummary of the data analyses performed on both data sets\n\nThe effect of background subtraction was examined by applying all methods on the background subtracted Spruce dataset and keeping the rest of the parameters constant i.e. same number of endmembers (4 EM), number of iterations (100,000) or convergence criterion (Figs.\n\n,\n\n). All algorithms delivered three very similar components: cell corner together with compound middle lamella (EM1), the S1 and S3 cell wall layers parallel to the laser polarization direction (EM2), showing the microfibrils oriented with high angle with respect to the fibre axis, and the main cell wall layer S2 (EM3) (Fig.\n\n). VCA brought the lumen in the 4th endmember, albeit the rest of algorithms did not. So once again, VCA behaves most different from the others in (1) resulting in the most different abundance maps and (2) a clear endmember for the water filled lumen. The other three methods traced in EM4 the compound middle lamella and/or cell corners (Fig.\n\n) with typical lignin spectra (Fig.\n\n). EM4 is strongly correlated with EM1 using the NMF and MCR approaches (Additional file\n\n: Table S1B), as both endmembers represent lignin, but of different composition/structure (Fig.\n\n).\n\nComparison of abundance maps given by VCA, NMF, MCR-ALS without PCA and MCR-ALS with PCA on background subtracted Raman data of Spruce based on 4 endmembers\n\nComparison of multivariate methods on background subtracted Raman data of Spruce. Endmember spectra given by VCA (in red), NMF (in black), MCR-ALS without PCA (in blue) and MCR-ALS with PCA (in green). Endmembers are grouped following the column order given by Fig.\n\nIn general, the correlation coefficients between endmembers within each method increase significantly after background correction, although MCR with PCA preserves a higher difference (Additional file\n\n: Table S1B). Unfortunately, this higher difference is also reflected in \u201cartificial\u201d not meaningful spectra (green spectrum, EM3, Fig.\n\n), where neither the lignin nor the cellulose bands are recovered in their typical form.\n\nThe comparison with (Figs.\n\n,\n\n) and without baseline correction (Figs.\n\n,\n\n) clearly showed that removing the background eases to reveal differences in cellulose structure. The cell wall layers with high cellulose microfibril angle (S1) are described by one endmember after background subtraction (Figs.\n\nand\n\n, EM2). While the VCA abundance map displayed the S1 selectively, all others methods resulted in medium (grey) values in the S2 layer as well. At the same time changes in the aromatic composition are more difficult to track and overseen by VCA. In a next step the number of endmembers was increased to 5 to explore the potential if subtle compositional changes in cell wall composition could still be revealed.\n\nThe dataset Spruce was analysed by all three approaches with 5 initial endmembers and after baseline correction (Figs.\n\n,\n\n). The correlation coefficients within the methods for the case are displayed in Additional file\n\n. The first three endmembers (EM1, EM2 and EM3) are again distinguishing the three most different wood tissue parts (Fig.\n\n). Especially the first two endmember spectra become now very similar in the three approaches, and differences are mainly found for EM3, EM4 and EM5 (Fig.\n\n). EM4 is rather inconsistent in relation to the pixel intensity distribution (Fig.\n\n), but also to the endmember spectral shape (Fig.\n\n). VCA pictures mainly middle lamella (cell corner earlywood) with a lignin-like endmember spectrum in Fig.\n\n. NMF pictures a patchy cell wall with higher intensity at tangential and radial cell junctions and is composed of lignin in its majority and polysaccharides in minor amounts. MCR-ALS without PCA remits the cell corners (Fig.\n\n, EM4) with other type of lignin composition (shoulder at 1635\u00a0cm\n\n) (see Fig.\n\n, EM4). The most dissonant endmember is given by MCR-ALS with prior PCA (Fig.\n\n) with both the cell wall S2 and partially the cell corners and again a very \u201cartificial\u201d not interpretable spectrum (Fig.\n\n). As the related endmember obtained with no filtering is very minor in presence, it seems that such a contribution may have disappeared after PCA filtering. The last endmember, EM5, portrays the water filled lumen for VCA and NMF (Fig.\n\n), whereas by both MCR-ALS variants the secondary cell wall is displayed again. The related spectra are matched also two by two: VCA and NMF deliver a Raman signature of water and both MCR-ALS analysis carry spectra with cell wall bands, but again in an unusual \u201cartificial\u201d manner. Model statistics (Table\n\n) did only improve slightly for NMF and MCR-ALS approaches and got worse for VCA, although this approach gave once again the most interpretable results and spectra.\n\nComparison of multivariate methods on Raman data of Spruce with 5 endmembers and previous background subtraction. Distribution maps given by all methods: from top to bottom VCA, NMF, MCR-ALS with no previous PCA and MCR-ALS with prior PCA\n\nComparison of endmember spectra given by VCA (in red), NMF (in black), MCR-ALS without PCA (in blue) and MCR-ALS with PCA (in green) of Raman data of Spruce with 5 endmembers and previous background subtraction\n\nAll algorithms were additionally tested on a more heterogeneous plant sample, a cross section of an\n\nstem (named Arabidopsis) whose anatomy is described in Fig.\n\nB. The recorded Raman image comprised different cell wall types: lignified xylem cells, cambium and phloem with primary cell walls. Again, different conditions (baseline correction, number of endmembers) have been tested, mainly by the fast VCA approach. Up to 6 endmembers, relevant pattern and spectra have been revealed and again an influence of background subtraction detected (see Additional file\n\n). Without background subtraction, the middle lamella and cell corners are better defined (EM1) (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1A). The second endmember shows pointwise distribution in the cell corner close to the cambial zone (EM2) with a distinct lignin band at 1634\u00a0cm\n\n(Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1C, red spectrum), pointing to different lignin composition during cell wall formation. After background correction (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1B) this differentiation is less clear and the distribution patterns (EM1, EM2) show stripe-wise artefacts. For these reasons, no background correction was selected for comparison of the three approaches (VCA, NMF, MCR-ALS) on Arabidopsis. The rest of the endmembers are in general very similar and describe carbohydrates (EM3, EM4), proteins and lipids (EM5) and the lumen (EM6). Thus also in this dataset the influence of background subtraction is observed mainly for endmembers involving aromatic cell wall components.\n\nFigures\n\nand\n\nshow the comparison of all abundance maps and their corresponding endmember spectra, respectively, given by the four methods for Arabidopsis without background correction. The different approaches result in similar abundance maps, especially EM1 and EM4 representing the xylem cell corner and compound middle lamella (EM1) and cell wall (EM4). Differences are observed for the other EMs; this time especially NMF is most different from the rest of the methods. NMF yields for EM2 a combination of cell corners and cell wall with a pointwise distribution of the highest intensity, whereas for all the remaining three analyses only the cell corners near the cambial zone are emphasized (Fig.\n\n). Yet all approaches agree in finding a 1633\u00a0cm\n\nband (Fig.\n\n, EM2), which is assigned to C=C of coniferyl alcohol and C=O of coniferyl aldehyde aldehydes in the lignin structure [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n]. While only a shoulder with VCA, the other two (NMF and MCR) end up in a sharp band. NMF shows also cellulose bands (1122, 1094\u00a0cm\n\n) in accordance with the highlighted cell wall in the abundance map. In addition, NMF diverges in the abundance map of EM3, where beside the enhancement of the S1 wall of the xylem, also the primary cell wall (cambium and phloem) is highlighted together with the S1 cell wall layer of the xylem. The corresponding EM3 spectrum shows beside the characteristic cellulose orientation sensitive band at 1095\u00a0cm\n\n, a clear pectin signal at 855\u00a0cm\n\nfor the \u03b1-1,4-glycosidic bond [\n\n] and no contribution in the aromatic regions (black spectrum), whereas the others did. In EM4 the aromatic contribution was different between the approaches [high 1600\u00a0cm\n\nband for VCA, medium for NMF and MCR without PCA, no aromatics and almost pure cellulose for MCR with PCA, (Fig.\n\n)], although the abundance maps are similar for all methods (Fig.\n\n). EM5 presents in all methods material attached to the cell wall, mainly in the phloem part (Fig.\n\n). The EM5 spectra coincide well between all methods (Fig.\n\n) with bands assigned to proteins and lipids (amide III band at 1666\u00a0cm\n\n, CH\n\nand asymmetric CH\n\nbending at 1450\u00a0cm\n\nand phenylalanine at 1005\u00a0cm\n\n) [\n\n\u2013\n\n]. VCA (in red) is the only one having also the aromatic band at 1600\u00a0cm\n\n. In EM6 all methods highlight the lumen, but NMF also the primary cell wall. The two MCR approaches additionally depict further cell wall features i.e. the thick cell wall layer S2 of the interfascicular fibers (in white, Fig.\n\n).\n\nComparison of multivariate methods on raw Raman data of Arabidopsis without previous baseline correction. Abundance maps given by VCA, NMF, MCR-ALS without PCA and MCR-ALS with PCA.\n\nxylem,\n\ncambium and\n\nphloem\n\nComparison of multivariate methods on raw Raman data of Arabidopsis. The endmember spectra were baseline corrected and each endmember group was normalised against the most intense band (EM1: 1600, EM2: 1600, EM3: 1095, EM4: 1122 and EM5: 1458\u00a0cm\n\n) except for the EM6 due to the lack of a common most intense band\n\nCorrelation coefficients between spectral endmembers (see Additional file\n\n) within the same method are lower than for data set Spruce (see Additional files\n\nand\n\n), ratifying the higher heterogeneity of the sample Arabidopsis. The lowest values are again for MCR with previous PCA, followed by NMF. In the same manner as for data set Spruce, VCA presents the highest correlation values between endmembers. This confirms the finding of the endmember spectra, where VCA showed more mixtures of the different components, whereas NMF and MCR resulted in more \u201cpure\u201d component spectra.\n\nFor all constraints and methods, the correlation coefficient between each VCA and the rest of endmembers given by the other algorithms was calculated prior any pre-processing, and is shown in Additional files\n\n,\n\nand\n\nfor Spruce with 4EM (with and without baseline correction), Spruce with 5EM (with background correction) and Arabidopsis with 6EM (with background subtraction), respectively. The highest correlations match the endmember assignments.\n\nPlant cell walls are highly variable biological materials, which differ in their structure and composition to fulfil different requirements in the living plant [\n\n,\n\n]. In order to assess the suitability of multivariate unmixing methods for the resolution of Raman imaging of plant material in a more general case, data have been acquired on different cell walls of two species. Wooden secondary cell walls of a spruce tree as well as a stem section of\n\nhave been analysed by multivariate analysis approaches. The stem area measured in spruce comprises the thin walled earlywood cells optimized for water transport as well as the thick walled latewood cells, which give the tree mechanical support (Fig.\n\nA). Between these two functional tissues, no differences have been revealed based on the acquired spectra. The stem of\n\nincludes different cell wall types: the phloem (living cells for transport of solutes from the leaves to growing tissues), cambium (dividing cells) and the xylem (dead cells for water transport from the root to the leaves) (Fig.\n\nB), which showed clear differences based on the Raman images. These generated images of plant tissues are well known, which facilitates the interpretation of the data, and also offer a great example for the application of multivariate methods due to the high correlation at the topochemical level (pixels far away might be related) but also at the chemical level (pixel spectra are highly correlated).\n\nMultivariate spectral unmixing analysis describes the input Raman images as a combination of concentration maps and spectral Raman signatures or endmembers (chemical composition) based on several premises and constraints, which might differ to pursue the most appropriate resolution. A summary of all analyses performed and their lack of fit and variance explained by the model is given in Table\n\n. In all cases better statistics (high explained variance, low lack of fit) are achieved by MCR-ALS and NMF approaches compared to VCA. VCA works sequentially and assuming the presence of pure endmembers, unlike NMF or MCR-ALS, which optimize the endmembers simultaneously, balancing the correlation between endmembers and seeking for the highest variance. This simultaneous extraction helps in obtaining components with less correlation among them with the latter two (see Additional files\n\n,\n\nand\n\n). MCR-ALS with PCA filtering delivered often the least correlated endmembers, but sometimes spectral signatures exhibited inverted meaningless bands in the endmember spectra (e.g. Figure\n\n, EM1 and EM4, in green). The results have shown the risk of PCA filtering when small variance contributions are of interest (high rank), since these can be lost in the discarded noise-related principal components.\n\nThe approximate number of endmembers can be determined by taking into account the previous knowledge on the inner variability in the sample (known components) but also by performing singular value decomposition, which factorizes the original data matrix and delivers the eigenvectors, ordered following the amount of variance explained. Since small variance contributions could be mistaken as noise contributions, it is advisable using the unmixing methods with a variable number of components to investigate whether also minor contributions can be modelled in a meaningful way.\n\nFor Spruce, different numbers of endmembers (2, 3, 4 and 5 EMs) were tested for VCA and NMF (see Additional files\n\n,\n\nand\n\n, and Figs.\n\n,\n\n). The results differed mostly at low rank values and is again a consequence of the different way of extracting components: VCA prioritizes extracting the positive endmembers, obtained by sequential orthogonal projections, whereas NMF or MCR-ALS extract simultaneously all components and seek explaining the maximum variance of the data set using a pre-set model size. Therefore, the latter two methods tend to extract preferentially high signal contributions that may account for a higher percentage of variance explained when the rank is too low. This explains that using 2 or 3 endmembers NMF did not include an endmember for the lumen (water), which is a contribution with very low signal intensity, but very different in spectral shape from the rest, while VCA extracted it (see Additional files\n\nand\n\n, top). With higher rank (4, 5, 6) the most severe differences between the methods are always found for the low intensity endmember spectra (Figs.\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). VCA always gives the most correlated endmembers (Additional files\n\n,\n\nand\n\n), but all bands in endmember spectra are biological meaningful, even with high rank. In contrast, the other methods (especially MCR with PCA) may sometimes result in less interpretable spectral shapes in high rank endmember spectra, although often the best model statistics (uncorrelated EM, high explained variance and low lack of fit) are achieved (Table\n\n).\n\nMultivariate analysis of spectroscopic data is influenced by the preprocessing strategy, especially baseline correction. As mentioned before, background subtraction might induce the loss of small features in the data if background differences are related to compositional changes. On the other hand, relevant signal features can be enhanced and differentiation among contributions might become easier after background subtraction. Which side weights more is a matter of method, data set and research question.\n\nThe results given by VCA were quite similar between non- and background subtracted data, for ranks of 2 and 3 endmembers (Additional files\n\nand\n\n, top). For the same rank, NMF shows more differences among background and non-background corrected data (Additional files\n\nand\n\n, bottom), again because of the different way of extracting components. While VCA always has one endmember describing the lumen as most different, NMF reveals already more detailed changes in chemistry and structure. With 3 endmember it is clearly seen that without baseline correction EM2 describes the cell corner with different aromatic structure (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S3A), while with background subtraction a change in cellulose microfibril angle is revealed in the S1 layer (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S3B). This trend of emphasizing either aromatic differences without baseline correction or changes in cellulose microfibril angle after baseline correction is clearly confirmed by all three approaches when 4 endmembers are used for calculation (compare Figs.\n\nand\n\nwith Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The distinct lignin component (Figs.\n\n,\n\n, EM1) found when no background subtraction was applied was replaced by the radial cell wall layer S1 (Figs.\n\n,\n\n, EM2 with cellulose microfibrils parallel to the laser polarization) after the analyses on baseline corrected data. Certainly, the prior EM1 and EM2 (Figs.\n\n,\n\n) was enclosed in the current EM1 as seen by the presence of the pectin band at 856\u00a0cm\n\n(Figs.\n\n,\n\n), which might indicate that a rank of 5EM could be useful for this particular differentiation. Despite background subtraction, VCA was again the single algorithm handing the water in lumen as an endmember (Figs.\n\n,\n\n, EM4) because there is still a residual contribution of this component with a sufficiently distinct shape. For NMF and MCR-ALS this may not happen because the variance due to background contribution is almost totally removed and the methods focus on capturing spectral variations linked to higher percentages of variance. Thus, the 4\n\nendmember did not become alike after pre-processing, but showed for NMF and both MCR-ALS features of the middle lamella with lignin bands at 1140, 1270, 1600 and 1660\u00a0cm\n\n. The ratio between the bands at 1600 and 1660\u00a0cm\n\nof EM4 changed between methods, indicating a different resolution of the ratio of C=C in lignin [\n\n]. MCR-ALS without previous PCA was able to resolve both two types of lignin and the S1 radial cell wall layer and its spectral signature was the most different with the highest 1600/1660 ratio and the additional presence of the shoulder at 1634\u00a0cm\n\n(Fig.\n\n, EM4, in blue).\n\nThe correlation between endmembers within the same method increased and the values were more akin amidst methods [Additional file\n\n: Table S1A (not baseline corrected) and 1B (with prior baseline correction)]. This also clearly shows that variability has been removed by background subtraction. The background subtraction affected differently each method in terms of lack of fit. The lack of fit of the model given by VCA (rank\u2009=\u20094EM) increased when background subtraction was carried out (Table\n\n) because the algorithm still sought the lumen contribution, very different in shape to the rest and now with very low variance. For NMF, the lack of fit decreased substantially, indicating a better performance when background subtraction was applied. For NMF and both MCR-ALS variants, the lack of fit was generally lower because these methods seek the explanation of the maximum variance with a predefined model size.\n\nFor Arabidopsis, the background correction had not so much influence on the resulting endmembers, although this dataset showed more types of cell walls and thus more variability. The VCA analysis with and without background subtraction (Additional file\n\n) resulted in similar abundance maps and spectra using 6 endmembers. After baseline correction some abundance maps showed a striped pattern (especially EM1 and EM2), probably an effect of the noise of the CCD camera [\n\n]. Furthermore, without baseline the cell corners were selectively spotted near the cambial zone, whereas after baseline correction also other tissues have been included. This showed that cell corners near the cambial zone had differed composition (spectral band shoulder at 1634\u00a0cm\n\n) (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1C red spectrum), not seen after baseline correction (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1D, red spectrum). Based on this information and due to the stripes no previous background subtraction was selected for the final analysis and comparison among methods (Figs.\n\n,\n\n).\n\nThe results on data set Spruce clearly showed that the rank has to be adjusted according to the algorithm and/or background correction. While VCA needed a 5th endmember to resolve the change in aromatics and microfibril orientation, the other approaches revealed these differences after baseline correction already with 4 endmember (Fig.\n\n). This is due to the already discussed fact that VCA always attributes one endmember to describe the watery lumen, while the others do not (details see above). If no baseline correction is done (Fig.\n\n) it becomes absolutely necessary for all methods to use 5EM, if additionally, the change in cellulose microfibril angle in the S1 layer is of interest. In the case of Spruce, for VCA, 5EM with prior background subtraction gave the best results. For the rest of the methods, 4EM with previous background subtraction were enough since the background signal is taken as an offset or in the residuals of the algorithm.\n\nAll analysis showed that the performance of the different methods is dependent on the number of endmembers and the pre-processing strategy and it has to be adapted to every algorithm.\n\nAll unmixing methods revealed in both data sets almost pure lignin spectra from the cell corners and compound middle lamella in-between the cells. Similar like in previous VCA-studies on wooden cell wall [\n\n], additional changes in lignin composition have been revealed, which would be overseen by simple band integration approaches. Cellulose came not as a pure endmember in Spruce, as no pure pixel has been found in this dataset. The analysis of poplar tension wood with Raman microscopy and MCR-ALS [\n\n] could reveal a pure cellulose endmember, as the G-layer with pure cellulose was present. They suggested to work with four endmembers and discarded the rest as not unique. In our 2nd example on Arabidopsis the 6 endmembers delivered by VCA are optimal without baseline correction, as abundance maps display very different anatomical regions and all endmember spectra are interpretable. In all the analysis done so far, the VCA approach always gave the most interpretable spectra, but with the tendency to include more mixtures of different components. NMF and MCR-ALS approaches seem to retrieve the purest (less correlated) EMs, but sometimes include less expected band shapes. Especially MCR-ALS with PCA filtering has more risk of not retrieving subtle differences even choosing more endmembers because of the possible discard of useful information. In these cases, bands less easily interpretable may show up (e.g. Fig.\n\n: green spectrum EM3, Fig.\n\n: green spectrum EM4, Fig.\n\n: green spectrum EM3, EM6). The thin cambial and phloem cells with low Raman intensity are in this example best retrieved by NMF in EM3: clearly visualized in the abundance maps (Fig.\n\n) and with a pectin band in the EM3 spectrum (Fig.\n\n). Nevertheless, a pure pectin spectrum was not revealed in this data set with the current settings, as it is mixed with cellulose in the S1 (high microfibril angle). Analysis of the epidermis of Arabidopsis in a previous VCA analysis revealed clearly a very pure pectin spectrum [\n\n]. On contrary NMF analysis of the cambial cells walls of a carrot root retrieved cellulose together with pectin [\n\n]. By applying a sparse NMF version, which incorporates graph relationship to overcome overlapping problems, spectra of pectin, cellulose and lignin were unmixed from a Raman image of a Longjing tea cell [\n\n]. However, in the latter study, very artificial endmember spectra were found that did not match Raman spectra of reference substances in the literature [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n].\n\nWith all four unmixing approaches the main trends in plant tissues are found consistently. As discussed above, differences arise in minor or very similar components, due to the factors driving the extraction of components in the different approaches and the general calculated statistics [correlation of endmember (r), lack of fit, explained variances] may vary as well.\n\nThe main differences in the working procedure of the algorithms are:\n\nThe sequential optimization of components in VCA based on a series of orthogonal projections versus the global optimization by NMF and MCR-ALS based on achieving a maximum of variance explained. This makes that NMF and MCR provide generally an overall better description of the image data, with higher variance explained, and a major differentiation of all compounds since they are optimized simultaneously. VCA instead can sometimes point out very small variance contributions linked to components with very distinct spectrum that would need models with higher rank to be found.\n\nThe assumption of closure (sum of abundances equal to 1) in VCA, which is needed for the optimization, is absent in NMF and MCR-ALS. The assumption of this constraint in VCA is an additional element that makes the model fit worse than for NMF and MCR in similar conditions, since a constraint not obeyed by the system is forced to obtain the final solutions.\n\nThe use of a PCA step to set the experimental space in VCA and to do optionally noise-filtering in MCR-ALS, as opposed to NMF and MCR-ALS with no PCA filtering step. This PCA step is, in itself, not questionable, but may have different effects depending on the data set. As a general rule, the PCA step is beneficial since it implies a reduction of noise and helps to a better definition of the experimental space in VCA and a more stable least-squares optimization in MCR. However, it should be taken into account the risk that very subtle spectral differences or very minor contributions may occasionally be sent to the discarded \u2018noise-related\u2019 components and may not be recovered in the final unmixing results. In the case of MCR, an advisable practice is running the algorithm with and without the PCA filtering step to check for the presence of this risk. Or even better, applying more powerful constraints and work, whenever possible, in multiset analysis mode.\n\nIn terms of computation time, VCA is slightly faster than MCR-ALS and no choice of constraints or other tuneable parameters has to be performed. This makes it a suitable method to perform a quick exploration of data sets and may help to select rank. NMF has a computation time significantly higher than MCR-ALS but provides stable solutions if a sufficient number of iterations is allowed. MCR-ALS instead has a reasonable computation time and may allow for accommodating many other powerful constraints other than non-negativity that could help in a better differentiation of similar biological components.\n\nRaman spectroscopic imaging combined with multivariate data analysis gives detailed insights into plant cell wall design. The Raman spectra can be used to differentiate regions different in chemistry as well as in structural organization (cellulose microfibril angle). Even subtle changes in composition and structure are visualized and based on the pure component (endmember) spectra and the related maps, the heterogeneous plant structure can be properly described. In addition, unmixing of Raman plant images offers a step ahead in the definition of completely new tissues, cell or cell layer identification and classification.\n\nAll unmixing methods yield spectral vectors that exhibit signal-to-noise ratios vastly better than those of individual spectra and that describe different components (e.g. lignin, pectin) and/or anatomical regions (e.g. cell wall layers S1, S2). They do not rely on previous knowledge and personal decisions of selecting areas or thresholds for calculating average spectra to describe different plant tissues. Nevertheless, the effect of baseline correction and the number of endmembers have to be taken into account and selected according to the data set, research question and unmixing algorithm. The background signal can be in some cases advantageous since different chemical components generate a different background and, therefore, it can be useful to better differentiate similar components. On the contrary, when background is very dominant, this contribution may hinder the differentiation of subtle spectroscopic features in other relevant bands. Furthermore, the number of components to be resolved should be adapted accordingly in order to obtain the best description of the sample. While for VCA and NMF no baseline correction and up to 6 endmembers revealed interpretable interesting results in the examples presented, MCR-ALS approaches in Raman data of plant cell walls worked better with baseline corrected data and a smaller number of endmembers to describe the data.\n\nCorrelation coefficients between endmembers of each algorithm (VCA, NMF, MCR without previous PCA and with previous PCA) based on 4 endmembers of Spruce (A) without and (B) with prior background (BG) subtraction, ordered in descending order.\n\nCorrelation coefficients between the spectral endmembers generated by the algorithms (with 5 endmembers) for Spruce with previous background subtraction.\n\nInfluence of background subtraction on the Vertex Component Analysis with 6 endmembers on\n\n.

    "full_text": "Hypertension affects 26.4% of the global adult population remaining the leading preventable risk factor for premature death and disability worldwide (\n\n,\n\n). Besides the majority of patients with primary (essential) hypertension, a subgroup of ~10% of patients is affected by secondary hypertension. Among the underlying diseases several are of endocrine origin and thyroidal impairments represent an even smaller percentage of the secondary hypertension cases; their incidence and form of presentation varies with age and studied population (\n\n). Hypertension may be the initial clinical presentation for at least 15 endocrine disorders (\n\n), including overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. The correction of thyroid dysfunction may normalize blood pressure (BP) in most cases, therefore checking thyroid function is essential during the workup for hypertension.\n\nThyroid dysfunction, both hypo- and hyperthyroidism may increase the risk of hypertension (\n\n,\n\n). Hypothyroidism should be considered as a graded phenomenon with a wide variety of clinical conditions from subclinical hypothyroidism to myxedema. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a combination of serum thyrotropin (TSH) above the upper reference limit and normal free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels (\n\n). This definition is only applicable in the absence of other acute or chronic recent or ongoing severe illness, assuming a stable thyroid function weeks or more before the evaluation and a normally functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Overt hypothyroidism is characterized by an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, in combination with reduced circulating fT4 and fT3 levels.\n\nWhile the most common cause of hypothyroidism had been environmental iodine deficiency for centuries, the situation has changed and the population became iodine sufficient or only mildly deficient. Since then, the leading causes of hypothyroidism are chronic autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is 5\u201310 times more common in women than in men, characterized by an increased prevalence with age (\n\n,\n\n). In AITDs the thyroid gland is infiltrated by sensitized T lymphocytes, while circulating thyroid autoantibodies can be detected as a consequence of presumably inherited defect in immune surveillance. Furthermore, hypothyroidism may occur as a consequence of radioiodine or surgical treatment for hyperthyroidism, benign nodular thyroid disease or thyroid cancer, and after external beam radiation for head and neck malignancies. Pharmacological treatment, in most of the cases administration of the iodine-containing antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone, lithium, or immune response modulators, such as interferon alfa can result in the development of thyroiditis and thyroid dysfunction; relatively new iatrogenic causes of hypothyroidism are tyrosine kinase inhibitors and PD-1 inhibitors, sunitinib, and nivolumab, respectively. Sunitinib induces hypothyroidism via reduction of glandular vascularization and induction of type 3 deiodinase enzyme (\n\n,\n\n). The mechanism by which nivolumab impairs the thyroid function is not entirely understood; the explanation might be a reduction in the immune tolerance to normal thyroid tissue antigens (\n\n). Central causes of hypothyroidism are acquired or congenital of origin; pituitary or hypothalamic tumors (including craniopharyngiomas), inflammatory (lymphocytic or granulomatous hypophysitis) or infiltrative diseases, hemorrhagic necrosis (Sheehan's syndrome), or surgical and radiation treatment for pituitary or hypothalamic disease can stay in the background of insufficient production of bioactive TSH (\n\n).\n\nThe reported prevalence rate of overt hypothyroidism is between 0.2 and 5.3% in Europe and 0.3\u20133.7% in the United States, most probably due to the differences in iodine intake (\n\n). The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism was found to be 7.5% in the Wickham study (\n\n), while in the Colorado study 21% among women and 16% in men, respectively (\n\n). The levels of circulating TSH and antithyroid autoantibodies increase with advancing age; according to the NHANES III data TSH levels above 4.5 mIU/L are present in 14% of the population aged 85 and above (\n\n).\n\nThe most common causes of hyperthyroidism are autoimmune Graves' disease and multinodular goiter. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism can be a consequence of iodine exposure during administration of iodine-containing drugs among which far the most important is amiodarone, or excess of levothyroxine replacement therapy. Immune response modulator therapy of cancers can lead to hypo- and less frequently hyperthyroidism (\n\n). Subacute thyroiditis is a less frequent cause of hyperthyroidism. Iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism is the declared aim of T4 therapy, and is a relatively frequent condition among patients with differentiated thyroid cancer after near-total thyroidectomy. Further, a few weeks of iatrogenic overt hypothyroidism is an alternative to recombinant TSH administration before radioiodine treatment and during follow-up, in accordance with international guidelines.\n\nThe prevalence of thyrotoxicosis among women is between 0.5 and 2%, a 10-fold female predominance is present. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a condition of mild thyroid hormone excess defined by a serum TSH concentration below the lower reference limit and normal serum fT4 and fT3 concentrations. The same biochemical pattern may describe hypothalamic or pituitary disease, non-thyroidal illness, or the pharmacologic effect of TSH secretion inhibiting drugs. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism ranges from 0.5 to 6.3%, with the highest established prevalence in individuals over 65 years; approximately half of the affected patients are on levothyroxine substitution (\n\n).\n\nOther relatively common thyroid diseases as multinodular goiter with euthyroidism and differentiated thyroid cancer have sparse impact on the cardiovascular system, and especially, the development of hypertension; however, a recently published meta-analysis found that hypertension significantly increases the risk of development of thyroid cancer (\n\n).\n\nThis review focuses on the common functional thyroid disorders, hypo- and hyperthyroidism that have impact on the cardiovascular system and especially hypertension. The underlying causes of thyroid dysfunction are listed in\n\n.\n\nCauses of thyroid dysfuntions.\n\nTriiodothyronine is the biologically active form of thyroid hormone derived from 5\u2032-monodeiodination of thyroxine in all tissues outside of the thyroid gland, particularly the kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle. The basal metabolic rate is affected by fT3 via altering oxygen consumption, substrate requirements and tissue thermogenesis (\n\n). Thyroid hormones have direct and indirect cellular effects on the cardiovascular system. In hyperthyroidism systemic vascular resistance decreases as fT3 dilates resistance arterioles of the peripheral circulation, which results in the fall of the effective arterial filling followed by stimulation of renin release and activation of the angiotensin-aldosterone axis (\n\n).\n\nPatients with hyperthyroidism present with increased heart rate, increased pulse amplitude, and increased cardiac output by up to 300%, which resembles a state of increased adrenergic activity (\n\n,\n\n), despite normal or low serum concentrations of catecholamines. Other hormonal factors are also affected: the levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, endothelin-1 and the vasodilating polypeptide adrenomedullin are elevated in hyperthyroidism (\n\n,\n\n). Thyroid hormone also stimulates erythropoietin secretion. Furthermore, T3 directly increases cardiac contractility, leading to widened pulse pressure (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). The coexistence of ischemic or hypertensive heart disease in a thyroid patient may compromise the ability of the myocardium to respond to the increased metabolic needs in hyperthyroidism and demands caution from the clinician (\n\n).\n\nThe mortality of patients with hyperthyroidism was found to be increased by 20%, and the major causes of death are due to cardiovascular origin (\n\n). The level of cardiac T3, as myocyte intracellular deiodinase activity is not significant, is fundamental in maintaining cardiac morphology and function in adult life via genomic and non-genomic effects. The expression of the main structural and regulatory genes is regulated by T3. Positively regulated genes as \u03b1-myosin heavy chain, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\n\n-ATPase, \u03b21-adrenergic receptor, atrial natriuretic hormone and voltage-gated potassium channels also contribute to the development of cardiac output increase observed in hyperthyroidism (\n\n). In contrary, the inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\n\n-ATPase phospholamban is negatively regulated, as well as the genes of \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, adenylyl cyclase catalytic subunits, Na\n\n/Ca\n\nexchanger and thyroid hormone receptor \u03b11 (\n\n). Non-genomic effects of T3 can develop rapidly in the cardiovascular system not requiring thyroid hormone response element-mediated transcriptional events and altering or modulating the effects of genomic mechanisms (\n\n).\n\nAccording to earlier studies heart failure develops in 6\u201316% of patients with hyperthyroidism. Patients with preexisting hypertension or with risk factors for coronary artery disease have a more pronounced risk for developing hemodynamic changes leading to chronic heart failure. A relatively frequent complication of hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, is an independent predictor for the development of chronic heart failure (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nArterial stiffness is increased in hyperthyroidism (\n\n) due to the effect of thyroxin on vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells via genomic and non-genomic action targeting membrane ion channels and endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (\n\n). In addition, the Calcium/ Calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV), which is known to be a major thyroid hormone target gene during brain development, plays an important role in blood pressure regulation through the control of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOC) activity (\n\n\u2013\n\n).\n\nThe hemodynamic effects of hypothyroidism are opposite to those of hyperthyroidism, although the clinical manifestations are less obvious with bradycardia being the most common sign accompanied by mild hypertension and a narrowed pulse pressure. Bradycardia, decreased ventricular filling and cardiac contractility together lead to low cardiac output. An increase in the systemic vascular resistance and slowed ventricular diastolic relaxation and filling are present. The decreased metabolic rate leads to a decline in peripheral oxygen demand, consequently heart failure is a rare clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism (\n\n). Elevated diastolic blood pressure is present in ~30% of patients with overt hypothyroidism. Cardiac contractility and output decreases leading to a narrowed pulse pressure. In hypothyroidism renin release is decreased with an increased salt sensitivity. The consequent renal sodium reabsorption leads to an expansion of blood volume by 5.5% (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n).\n\nWe have previously shown that in patients who had undergone thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, increased aortic stiffness and impaired diastolic function can be detected during induced overt hypothyroidism, which is part of the diagnostic follow-up procedure (\n\n).\n\nSeveral clinical data suggest that autoimmune thyroid disease may be responsible for the development of primary pulmonary hypertension in both hyper- and hypothyroidism; therefore in pulmonary hypertension (PH) thyroid function should be evaluated (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nThe effects of the functional thyroid disorders on the cardiovascular system leading to hypertension are summarized in\n\n.\n\nEffects of functional thyroid disorders on the cardiovascular system leading to hypertension.\n\nWhile a normal TSH and consequently fT4 and fT3 within the physiological range are essential in growth, differentiation and maintenance of adequate function of all human organs, several genetic defects have been evaluated and described in the route of thyroid hormone signaling during the past decade, including those with mutations in thyroid hormone transporters and receptors (\n\n). According to novel studies, even minor changes in the thyroid hormone levels can affect bone mineral density (\n\n), mental status (\n\n), and can also lead to impaired metabolism (\n\n), and increased cardiovascular risk (\n\n). While the levels of the serum thyroid hormones show marked inter-individual variability, there is no significant intra-individual variability, as TSH values change very little during time (\n\n). Based on these results a conclusion can be made that each individual has a unique thyroid set-point, defined by genetic and environmental factors such as iodine intake and smoking (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nThe genetic pattern of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis involves numerous genes with rare high-penetrance variants and common low-penetrance forms, mutations and polymorphisms, respectively. Several mutations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis were described to date and found responsible for impaired thyroid function (\n\n,\n\n). A large number of new genes were identified during the last decade that affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, some of which are responsible for thyroid dysfunction and consequently affect different organs and present risk factors for the development of different diseases, including hypertension.\n\nThyroid dysfunction is rarely attributed to single gene mutations. Numerous studies were performed in the last 2 years to reveal genetic variants presenting with polymorphisms associated with thyroid impairment and altered function. These encompass both linkage and candidate gene analyses targeting the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid pathway. A detailed overview of genes affecting the thyroid axis is found elsewhere (\n\n). A few polymorphisms were found to be associated with blood pressure; however, the results remain controversial. A couple of type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2) gene mutations were found to cause hypertension in middle-aged patients with euthyroidism (\n\n). Interestingly, these variants did not cause any changes in the circulating TSH or free thyroid hormone levels (\n\n,\n\n). These results were not confirmed by other clinical studies (\n\n,\n\n). A mutation in the thyrotropin releasing hormone receptor gene was characterized to be associated with an increased risk of essential high blood pressure (\n\n). The findings regarding gene mutations affecting blood pressure values remain controversial and need further evaluation.\n\nHyperthyroidism is accompanied by cardiovascular complications (cardiac arrhythmias, hypercoagulopathy, stroke, and pulmonary embolism) in a significant number of cases, leading to an increase in short-term morbidity and long-term morbidity and mortality. Brandt et al. found a significant 20% increase in mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism in their meta-analysis based on seven studies (\n\n).\n\nThe excess of T3 leads to metabolic and hemodynamic changes: metabolic rate, cardiac preload, and ventricular contractility increases while systemic vascular resistance decreases, causing an increased cardiac output and hypertension, as discussed above.\n\nThe highest risk of coronary heart disease mortality and atrial fibrillation is noted when serum TSH is below 0.10 mIU/l (\n\n).\n\nHemodynamic changes affect not only the left cardiac output, since pulmonary hypertension may also be present in patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves-disease or nodular goiter (\n\n). Pulmonary hypertension was found to be the most common complication in a study which investigated hyperthyroid patients by echocardiography (\n\n). The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension was detected to be relatively high among hyperthyroid patients, varying between 36 and 65%, although mild and asymptomatic cases were found to be the most common (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nIn the pharmacological treatment of systolic secondary hypertension caused by hyperfunction of the thyroid gland, besides reaching euthyroidism, non-selective beta-blockers are often preferred, for controlling the concomitant tachycardia and tremor effectively and blocking the peripheral T4 to T3 conversion (\n\n).\n\nThe increased cardiovascular mortality among patients with hyperthyroidism may be as well the consequence of shared genetic or environmental factors, based on the pronounced familial aggregation of hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, lifespan, and smoking habits (\n\n).\n\nOur group previously found that there is an increase in the aortic stiffness in combination with decreased diastolic function in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism on levothyroxine suppression therapy after total thyroidectomy due to differentiated thyroid cancer (\n\n).\n\nA study found that patients with hyperthyroidism and normal blood pressure during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) had higher systolic blood pressure than euthyroid normotensive participants. The successful treatment of hyperthyroidism resulted in normalization of systolic blood pressure. The nocturnal decrease in blood pressure did not differ from that of normal subjects (\n\n).\n\nIn a recently published study Lillevang-Johansen et al. investigated the association between hyperthyroidism and the occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) events among treated and untreated hyperthyroid patients (\n\n). The real-world data of this study revealed the impact of varying thyroid status on cardiovascular events: untreated and insufficiently treated hyperthyroid patients had increased cardiovascular risk. According to the data of more than 275,000 individuals followed-up for hyperthyroidism, sufficiently controlled thyrotoxicosis did not increase cardiovascular risk. After an adjustment for main cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, the findings were not significantly affected, suggesting that elevated thyroid hormone levels are playing a major role in the increase of CV risk (\n\n). These findings suggest that careful monitoring of treatment and maintaining euthyroidism is fundamental in the prevention of CV events among patients with hyperthyroidism.\n\nSubclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal serum TSH value accompanied by T4 and T3 within the normal reference range. The change in thyroid function needs to be evaluated and confirmed by a second laboratory measurement after 3\u20136 months (\n\n). The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism can be detected more frequently in iodine depleted areas and increases with advancing age (\n\n). According to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) 0.7% of 16,533 people were reported to have subclinical hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.1 mU/L); these subjects were not taking thyroid medication (\n\n). Subclinical hyperthyroidism can be classified into two categories: Grade 1, with a mild decrease of serum TSH (0.1\u20130.4 mIU/L), and Grade 2, with a more marked TSH decrease (TSH below 0.1 mIU/L) (\n\n).\n\nThe long exposure of the heart to subclinical hyperthyroidism leads to an altered cardiac morphology and function. As a consequence, left ventricular function changes: systolic function is enhanced, while diastolic function becomes impaired, a slowed myocardial relaxation is present resulting in an increase of left ventricular mass (\n\n); as well as increased heart rate and arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (\n\n).\n\nAlthough lipid profile is not affected unfavorably in subclinical hyperthyroidism, endothelial dysfunction and increased thrombogenicity is present (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n).\n\nA meta-analysis with more than 25,000 participants proved that subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease events and coronary artery disease mortality, and also with elevated total mortality. The risk for mortality due to coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation was more prominent in Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism (\n\n).\n\nIn the Rotterdam study involving more than 9,000 participants, the risk of cardiovascular mortality increased in a linear manner with subclinical hyperthyroidism and free T4 levels close to the upper limit of the reference range compared to those with free T4 levels close to the lower limit (\n\n). A large systematic review with data from more than 70,000 people found that subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with an increased risk of total mortality, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease mortality in patients with Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism (\n\n).\n\nBesides these changes in the cardiovascular risk due to subclinical hyperthyroidism, prospective cohort studies failed to show significant association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypertension (\n\n,\n\n). Due to the increased risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases and mortality, there is a wide agreement among specialists that treatment of patients with Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism should be initiated (\n\n).\n\nThyroid hormones affect biochemical and molecular mechanisms of lipid homeostasis resulting in a variable phenomenon of dyslipidemia (\n\n) mostly characterized by high serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and normal or even elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Furthermore, high serum concentrations of triglycerides, intermediate-density lipoproteins, apolipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B are frequently observed (\n\n\u2013\n\n). The primary mechanism in the background of hypercholesterolemia is the accumulation of LDL cholesterol due to reduction in the number and activity of the cell-surface LDL receptors resulting in decreased hepatic LDL catabolism. In addition to the direct effect of T3 on the promoter region of the LDL receptor gene, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SERBP-2) gene is also regulated by T3, resulting in the altered transcription of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and LDL receptor genes (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). Thyroid hormones also increase the activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein, hepatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (\n\n,\n\n). Although a substantial number of studies indicated a beneficial response in patients with TSH levels between 2.5 and 4.5 concerning atherosclerosis risk factors such as atherogenic lipid parameters, impaired endothelial function, and intima media thickness (\n\n,\n\n), TSH has no defined cutoff threshold regarding cardiovascular prevention and atherosclerosis (\n\n).\n\nA study of more than 30,000 patients showed similar results: increased LDL, non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides and decreased HDL with high-normal TSH levels still in the reference range (\n\n). Since the thyroid hormones have known regulatory effect on the lipid metabolism and consequently on blood pressure, their impact on the cardiovascular system may be partially explained by these mechanisms (\n\n,\n\n). Another large prospective study involving more than 14,000 participants with normal TSH levels at start and followed for 11 years found that high-normal TSH levels were predictive for moderately higher blood pressure in the future. Moreover, 1 mU/L elevation in the TSH values resulted in about 2 mmHg elevation in the systolic blood pressure, 1\u20132 mmHg increase in the diastolic blood pressure and 0.1 mmol/L rise in non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride values (\n\n).\n\nHypothyroidism being one of the most common secondary causes of dyslipidemia (\n\n) is clearly associated with an increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease owing to its metabolic and hemodynamic effects (\n\n). Atherosclerosis develops in patients with hypothyroidism as a consequence of multiple mechanisms including hyperlipidemia, hypercoagulable state, endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness which leads to arterial hypertension (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nThe atherogenic lipid changes in hypothyroidism, similarly to the ones in BP values, appear to develop rapidly, as seen in individuals with a hypothyroidism only 3 weeks following thyroidectomy due to non-toxic multinodular goiter (\n\n). Even low normal fT4 concentrations have been associated with a more atherogenic lipid profile (\n\n). In a study involving more than 5,000 participants a significant association has been described between LDL, total cholesterol and TSH levels ranging 3.5\u201310 mU/L (\n\n). Total cholesterol and LDL levels decreased in a crossover study after 100 \u03bcg levothyroxine supplementation of the subjects having TSH values greater than 6.1 mU/L (\n\n). The same result was observed in another study conducted among individually substituted patients with TSH greater than 8 mU/L (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nBesides dyslipidemia, changes in coagulation parameters are described in thyroid disorders being partly responsible for atherogenic changes. Decreased platelet count, aggregation and agglutination, von Willebrand factor antigen and activity, decreased levels of several coagulation factors such as factor VII, VIII, IX, XI, and plasminogen activator-1 can be detected in overt hypothyroidism leading to hypercoagulability. In subclinical hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease increased fibrinogen level, factor VII level and activity, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level have been detected rendering a tendency toward a hypercoagulable state (\n\n,\n\n). The mechanisms underlying the development of the changes in coagulation parameters in hypothyroidism are not well understood. A possible explanation might be the direct effect of the thyroid hormones. However, it is still unclear whether the thyroid hormone deficiency or the elevated TSH levels, or both, are responsible for the alteration in the coagulation parameters (\n\n).\n\nFurthermore, the association between hypothyroidism and defects in the secretion of endothelium-dependent dilation factors is well known (\n\n,\n\n). Endothelial cell TSH receptor induces multiple effects including the down-regulation of anti-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukine-6, in addition to the induction of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), and leukocyte adhesion (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin). Elevated expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules is related to endothelial dysfunction, which is believed to be an early step in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Assessment of endothelial dysfunction, as an early biomarker, is helpful in predicting cardiovascular risk and evaluating the outcome of treatment (\n\n). Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery is a functional test of the capacity of increased blood flow provoked by the release of endothelial NO and other vasodilator mediators, following induced ischemia, therefore, is an accepted early method for non-invasive assessment of systemic endothelial function (\n\n). Flow-mediated dilation was found to be impaired not only in patients with mild hypothyroidism but also in subjects with \u201chigh-normal\u201d serum TSH levels (\n\n). Another study also reported that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism had significantly lower flow-mediated dilation values (\n\n).\n\nDespite the above mentioned data, the association of subclinical hypothyroidism and atherosclerosis is still debated, although hyperlipidemia is usually present (\n\n,\n\n). Carotid artery intima-media thickness measurement remains a long-standing and reliable diagnostic modality used to assess vascular morbidity at an early stage (\n\n). A recent study revealed that carotid artery intima-media thickness is significantly higher in patients with both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism compared with normal control subjects (\n\n).\n\nCentral arterial stiffness is positively associated with systolic hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure, which are the leading causes of mortality in developed countries. Central arterial stiffening or reduced arterial compliance leads to augmented central blood pressure, increased cardiac afterload, and is an independent predictor of cardiac events (\n\n). A previous study confirmed that hypothyroidism is associated with increased augmentation of central aortic pressure and central arterial stiffness. Furthermore, these abnormalities are reversed after adequate T4 replacement (\n\n). Arterial stiffness was also increased in subclinical hypothyroidism and improved with L-thyroxine treatment (\n\n).\n\nThe above detailed impairment in the lipid metabolism due to hypothyroidism may contribute to the development or progression of hypertension. In addition, patients affected by hypothyroidism may have other concomitant cardiovascular diseases and consequently their summed effect on the blood pressure may be even more accentuated.\n\nA high prevalence of diastolic hypertension had been found in patients above 50 years of age with overt hypothyroidism whose blood pressure was normalized after adequate thyroid hormone replacement therapy (\n\n). However, hypothyroidism as a cause of hypertension is often overlooked. In an early study Saito et al. found a 3-fold higher prevalence of diastolic hypertension in hypothyroidism than in age-matched patients without thyroid disorder using the World Health Organization's (WHO) earlier used criteria for hypertension, namely blood pressure > 160/95 mmHg (\n\n,\n\n). According to the current ESC guidelines for the treatment of hypertension, in-office systolic blood pressure (SBP) values \u2265 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values \u2265 90 mmHg define hypertension based on evidence from multiple randomized clinical trials proving that treatment of patients with these BP values is beneficial (\n\n).\n\nMasked hypertension, defined as a normal in-office blood pressure in spite of higher values detected during an active day, can be found during evaluation via ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM); masked hypertension is present in ~15% of untreated patients. The prevalence of this condition is greater among younger men, who are affected by higher levels of anxiety and job stress. Furthermore, habits like smoking, alcohol consumption and more pronounced physical activity are more common among them (\n\n). Recently published data has suggest that many individuals with masked hypertension present with a higher left ventricular mass index, therefore a higher cardiovascular risk, in the detection of which ABPM seems more efficient than HBPM (\n\n). In a recently published pilot study, the occurrence of masked hypertension was evaluated among patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism using 24-h ABPM; a significantly higher prevalence of masked hypertension was found in both groups compared to controls with euthyroidism, which suggests the existence of elevated cardiovascular risk in hypothyroidism, especially in young male patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (\n\n).\n\nPositive association of serum TSH levels with arterial blood pressure was demonstrated through a cross-sectional analysis of pooled data from five population-based studies in adults (\n\n). The association was present in the full range of TSH and even within the reference range, while positive correlation was limited to prevalent hypertension, and not in a 5-year change of blood pressure or incident hypertension (\n\n). In patients who underwent thyroid surgery due to differentiated thyroid cancer and had overt hypothyroidism before radioiodine therapy, an elevation in nocturnal systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure was found; also, an increased number of non-dippers were found among these subjects (\n\n).\n\nHypothyroidism has been generally considered as a cardiovascular risk factor, as discussed above, stressing the need of routine screening for thyroid function especially among female patients with coronary heart disease or patients with known cardiovascular risk factors (\n\n). Subclinical hypothyroidism is a common entity, characterized by elevated TSH-levels and fT4 and fT3 levels in the normal range.\n\nThe association between elevated blood pressure and overt thyroid disorders has been thoroughly investigated and well-established, while the question whether subclinical changes in the thyroid function present potential risk for the development and maintenance of hypertension are still under debate. Some studies detected positive correlations of subclinical hypothyroidism and hypertension in women (\n\n,\n\n); however, the same results were not confirmed in men (\n\n,\n\n). A number of clinical studies assessed the relationship between subclinical thyroid dysfunction, both hypo and hyperthyroidism, and endothelial dysfunction (\n\n), arterial wall thickening (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n), atrial fibrillation (\n\n), and left ventricular hypertrophy (\n\n). A study involving more than 10.000 children and adolescents found a positive correlation between elevated serum TSH levels and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure; however, this correlation was not established with hypertension (\n\n). Upon these findings, one can presume an association between subclinical hypothyroidism and elevated risk for the development of hypertension.\n\nIn a large, population-based study with more than 30,000 participants the thyrotropin levels within the normal range were significantly correlated with the arterial blood pressure and hypertension as well in both genders; however, TSH levels above the upper limit presented positive association in women only (\n\n). One possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that TSH levels were measured only in half of the male participants and 100% of female patients. Furthermore, these inconsistent data may also be affected by the iodine intake of the studied population; the range of TSH level may differ upon the iodine supply of the studied region (\n\n). Studies that were conducted in regions with iodine excess like Far East Asia failed to find any correlation between blood pressure and TSH values within the normal range; these regions have higher thyrotropin reference range limits (\n\n,\n\n). On the contrary, several studies performed in regions characterized by mild to moderate iodine deficiency or even sufficient iodine intake showed a positive correlation between TSH level and blood pressure values (\n\n,\n\n). The differences observed in the results, however, may be partially due to the higher prevalence of hypertension in Far East Asia compared to Europe and the alternate screening and treatment methods used in these regions (\n\n).\n\nOverall, the data from several studies and pooled analyses suggest that the correlation between high serum thyrotropin levels and blood pressure changes might be time-dependent and cannot predict the further development of hypertension and might occur only during an actual TSH elevation (\n\n).\n\nIn a recently published meta-analysis the effect of levothyroxine replacement therapy on blood pressure in subclinical hypothyroidism was investigated. The summed results of 10 randomized clinical trials showed that after levothyroxine therapy systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly. A subgroup analysis suggested that the systolic blood pressure lowering effect was more accentuated in patients with higher TSH levels. In 19 prospective follow-up studies both systolic and diastolic blood pressure values decreased significantly after levothyroxine initiation (\n\n).\n\nAlterations of thyroid function may result in changes in blood pressure values as well as other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, leading to an increased cardiovascular risk, which is mild in most cases, although hyperthyroidism represents a significant elevation of cardiovascular mortality risk. The delayed clinical recognition of subclinical forms of thyroid dysfunction, i.e., subclinical hypo and hyperthyroidism has unfavorable cardiovascular effects. Available data suggest that, concerning cardiovascular risks, early diagnosis, and treatment of even mild forms of functional thyroid disorders might be beneficial in the vast majority of the patients. However, overtreatment should be avoided, and age-related or individual variances of pituitary-thyroid set-points have to be respected.\n\nAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication.\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n"

    "full_text": "About 10\u201320% of all surviving stroke patients suffer from drop-foot symptoms\n\n. This largely common characteristic in hemiplegic patients displays itself in a failure to dorsiflex the foot during the swing phase of the gait\n\nand constitutes a considerable decline in quality of life.\n\nThe most common strategy to treat those patients is to fixate their foot at a 90\u00b0 angle using an ankle foot orthesis (AFO)\n\n. The improvement in combination with the low costs result in the widespread use of AFOs as treatment of choice for drop-foot. But even though AFOs have been shown to improve gait-parameters up to about 6 months after stroke, data also indicate that in the long run (>12 months) AFOs do not have any additional therapeutic effect on gait speed or stance balance anymore\n\n.\n\nStudies showed very early that functional electrical stimulation (FES) of the impaired muscle could be used as an alternative to treat drop foot\n\n. Using FES, lower limb motor functionality can be improved in a variety of upper motor neuron lesions that leave the excitability of the impaired muscle fibers intact\n\n. In the last 55 years a variety of stimulation devices have been introduced in which the main principle of peroneal excitation remained unchanged\n\n. It has been described that the use of FESs results not just in an increase of actual dorsiflexion of the tibialis anterior to lift the foot\n\nbut also innervates previously silent muscle fibers\n\n, reduces spasticity of the affected leg\n\n, improves the symmetry of general gait posture\n\nand leads to a general increase in walking speed\n\n.\n\nInterestingly, already the first observations of FES in drop-foot describe not only an imminent improvement of gait during stimulation, but also a \u2018restoration\u2019 of voluntary dorsiflexion in between stimulation protocols\n\n. This purely therapeutic\n\neffect of FES becomes apparent especially in the long run during stimulator training\n\n. Some studies indicate that the therapeutic effect of FES hereby seems to outperform that of AFO-training\n\n.\n\nAuthors interpreted the therapeutic gain of long-term FES use as an indication of central neural plasticity processes triggered by the stimulation\n\n. The only data supporting this claim report a general increase of corticospinal excitability from transcranial magnetic stimulation over the motorcortex following training phases of peripheral stimulation\n\n.\n\nHowever up to now no direct evidence for neural plasticity changes in sensorimotor cortical areas following functional electric stimulation in drop foot is available. The current study presents first electrophysiological data, directly tracing cortical reorganization processes over time, in relation with changes of gait kinematics in patients with upper motor neuron lesions in their chronic state.\n\nEighteen patients with upper motor lesions gave written informed consent to participate in this study that was approved by ethics committee of the medical faculty of the Otto-von-Guericke university and was carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations. Patients were implanted with a partially implantable ActiGait system (OttoBock, Berlin). At the time of surgery all patients were in their chronic state in that all participants experienced their lesion incident more than two years ago except for one (1.7 years). Figure\n\nsummarizes all patients included in the following analyses together with individual imaging slices illustrating each patients\u2019 lesion.\n\nDescription of eleven included patients. (do88) right hemispheric medial cerebral artery infarct including medial parts of S1 and M1 extending into the parietal lobe (fx06) right subcortical lesion touching the posterior limb of the internal capsule (gm26) posthemorrhagic lesion on the left including cortical and subcortical S1 and M1 (gu60) left-sided lesion in A.-lenticulostriata territory touching cortical and subcortical parts of prefrontal and medial S1 and M1 extending into parietal lobe (gu75) lesion following intracerebral bleeding on the left touches medial S1 and M1 extending into superior parietal cortex (hp15) infarct of the left medial cerebral artery touching the medial S1 and M1 (le55) left-sided hemorrhage touching cortical and subcortical parts of frontal, medial S1 and M1 including superior parietal cortex (lp95) ischemia of the A.-thalamostriata territory including the posterior limb of the right internal capsule (sb65) right posthemorrhagic lesion including medial S1 and M1, posterior limb of the internal capsule extending into the temporal lobe (tv42) left-sided infarct including the posterior external capsule (yj24) ischemia including the left posterior limb of the internal capsule.\n\nMagnetencephalographic measurements as well as gait kinematic assessments were performed twice (T1/T2) with an average interval of about three to four months with T1 occurring shortly before or after operation. At both time points additional quality of life assessments with the SF-36 questionnaire were performed.\n\nGait kinematics were assessed using motion capture techniques (Vicon) in combination with Vicon Nexus\u2019 build-in Plug-In Gait algorithm based on the Newington-Helen Hayes gait model\n\n. Full body joint kinematics were calculated at the two examination time points (T1 and T2) for each subject. The full body model for each subject was created to each gait-analysis using a static trial in which rigid body segment positions were automatically identified based on 34 reflective markers attached to the body at standardized positions. Subsequently, multiple dynamic gait kinematics based on the Plug-In Gait full body model were recorded in which subjects had to walk across the distance of the capture area of 10\u2009m. Walks were recorded at T1 (shortly before or after stimulator implantation) under the condition of absent stimulation assisted gait (T1\n\n). For T2 different walks were recorded separately for the two different gait-conditions with and without active stimulation (T2\n\n, T2\n\n).\n\nEach walking condition was recorded twice. Marker trajectories for each dynamic gait recording were reconstructed offline and labeled based on the previously created static gait model. Subsequently, mislabeled markers were corrected manually and gaps were filled using Vicon Nexus software. Within each preprocessed dynamic gait recording each strike and foot-off gait-cycle event was identified manually. Gait-parameters for each gait-condition were then estimated using the dynamic gait model. For each subject at each time point and gait-condition (T1\n\n, T2\n\n, T2\n\n) the following three gait-parameters in reference to Perry\n\nwere estimated: cadence (m/s), steptime (s) and stridetime(s).\n\nFor two subjects dynamic gait recordings failed at one time point due to technical difficulties. Thus data from those subjects could not be used for further analysis.\n\nA structural MRI was recorded for each subject prior to the implantation of the device. Due to the institutes\u2019 safety guidelines structural MRIs could not be performed for two patients. In these patients lesions have been assessed using CT-scans. For all other patients a high resolution MPRAGE structural image was recorded using a 3\u2009T Siemens VERIO scanner (1.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009\u00d7\u20091.0\u2009mm, TR\u2009=\u20092500\u2009ms, TE\u2009=\u20094.82, TI\u2009=\u20091100\u2009ms, FlipAngle\u2009=\u20097\u00b0, FOV\u2009=\u2009256\u2009mm).\n\nStructural MRIs were used to create high-resolution surface reconstructions\n\nusing FreeSurfer (\n\n). Images with substantial cortical lesions were segmented using a semi-automatic white matter segmentation step\n\nprovided by FSL-library (\n\n)) after an initial reconstruction step to subsequently refine the final surface reconstruction.\n\nThe Surfaces were used to create individual realistic one-shell boundary element models (BEMs) and source models required for the estimation of individual distributed source models for the individual sensorimotor MEG-field distributions of each patient for each measurement.\n\nWe sought to track changes in the cortical organization of the sensorimotor cortex (SMC) over time in ischemic patients with implanted active peroneus stimulator within the lesioned as well as the unaffected hemisphere. Therefore, we localized the cortical responses to sensory stimulation to the left and right hand and took differences between these locations across the two time points within each hemisphere as an indicator for plasticity within the SMC. Cortical motor areas are highly interlinked with the corresponding topographical sensory areas due to motor-related proprioceptive feedback loops\n\n. Motor tasks for a specific limb part produce virtually the same activation as somatosensory stimulation of that same limb part in adjacent walls of the central sulcus\n\n.\n\nEvoked somatosensory magnetic fields were recorded at the two assessment time points in response to a short pneumatic stimulation of either the left or right hand (delivered by a custom made pneumatic stimulator). Each hand was stimulated in a separate experimental block. Before each block the pneumostimulator-tube was attached to the corresponding hand. Stimulation for each hand was repeated 400 times with a 2000\u2009ms inter-trial interval. Continuous magnetencephalographic data was recorded with a sampling rate of 2034.51\u2009Hz and an online low-pass filter of 400\u2009Hz over 248 magnetometer sites using a BTI Magnes 2500 WH (4-D Neuroimaging, San Diego, TX) whole head system. The position of all sensors relative to the head was determined at the beginning of each block by localizing the relative position of five coils attached to the head to the position of three fiducial points (nasion, LPA, RPA) digitized with a Polhemus tracker. Two patients were not able to finish one and two of the presented recording blocks at one of the examination time points, respectively, due to exhaustion. Consequently, incomplete data from those two subjects had to be excluded from further analysis.\n\nData preprocessing was performed with custom software using MATLAB (Mathworks) in combination with the\n\n-toolbox\n\n. Offline data were epoched from \u2212300\u2009ms to 600\u2009ms relative to the onset of the stimulation and subsequently baseline corrected. MEG-data of all patients contained a large amount of internal (alpha-band, heartbeat) as well as external (motion) noise. We therefore applied for each assessment time point an independent component analysis on the original, unfiltered and epoched data (across both condition blocks) to identify and separate sources of substantial noise from somatosensory evoked responses based on the components\u2019 topographical distributions as well as their averaged evoked responses. Identification of all extracted components for all patients at both time points was performed by an expert in the field. On average 19.44 (range: 6\u221229) and 20.33 (range: 11\u201329) components were removed at the two measurement time points respectively. The number of rejected components did not differ significantly between the measurements of each subject (F(1, 10)\u2009=\u20090.178, p\u2009>\u20090.5). The reconstructed datasets were averaged over evoked signals for each block (left/right hand) and low-pass filtered at 35\u2009Hz.\n\nThe decomposed MEG-signal of three patients at one or both time-points did not reveal clear somatosensory components, thus did not allow for a reconstruction of reliable somatosensory evoked fields. The data for these three patients were excluded from further analysis.\n\nThe first clear component of the evoked somatosensory responses for both hemispheres and measurement time points were modeled using Curry 7.0 Software (Neuroscan Inc.). We applied two different source reconstruction techniques in order to characterize the changes of the somatosensory hand-representations over time.\n\nTo compare the topographical changes we first modeled somatosensory field sources with a single dipole. For each individual subject evoked fields of each block and time-point were reoriented to a common spherical head-model using relative sensor locations as measured prior to each block. For each of the four field distributions (2 blocks (left/right hand)\u2009\u00d7\u20092 time points) the dipole position within the common spherical head-model was determined. Plasticity changes over time were then quantified as the difference vector between dipoles of the two time points within each hemisphere:\n\nand\n\n. Hereby,\n\ndescribe the dipole locations for the left and right hemisphere at the first and second MEG-session. Subsequently we compared the length of the difference vectors between the\n\n(\n\n) and\n\n(\n\n) hemisphere of each subject and calculated the relative distance change across the hemispheres as:\n\n. This approach is similar to the standard method of quantifying hemispheric recruitment in stroke patients by measuring relative strength differences between sensorimotoric cortices (laterality index: refs\n\n\u2013\n\n).\n\nAs a second approach we estimated the distributed source solution (L2 minimum norm) for each of the somatosensory evoked fields using high-resolution surface reconstructions based on realistic source space models derived from the MRI for each individual subject. Two subjects were omitted from this analysis because high resolution MRI data could not be obtained. The evoked fields were reoriented by realigning the fiducial points measured prior to each MEG-block (preauricular points and nasion) with those identified within the corresponding MPRAGE-image. The maximum current source densities of each patient for each stimulation condition and time point were identified within the corresponding postcentral gyrus. This analysis strategy was used to illustrate plastic changes within the individual left and right somatosensory cortex of each subject.\n\nChanges in quality of life were assessed by comparing SF-36 scores across time points using paired t-tests for the different sub-scales. Changes of gait parameters over gait conditions (T1\n\n, T2\n\n, T2\n\n) were tested using repeated measures ANOVAe. To determine whether relative changes in gait-parameters over time\n\ncan be explained by basic patient characteristics, they were correlated with the patients\u2019 descriptive variables (age, sex, lesioned hemisphere, time since incident, time between assessment time points and time between implantation and T1). The same analysis was also performed on the ECD-index, in order to determine whether cortical reorganization over time can be predicted by patients\u2019 characteristics at time point T1.\n\nTo investigate whether successful active stimulation by the prosthesis is directly related to cortical reorganization in sensorimotor areas, the dipole-Index was correlated with the relative changes of gait parameters over time\n\nand across stimulation condition at T2\n\n. Furthermore, patients were divided into two subgroups of subjects that showed higher cortical reorganization within the lesioned hemisphere (ECD-Index\u2009>\u20090, N\u2009=\u20096) and non-lesioned hemisphere (ECD-Index\u2009<\u20090, N\u2009=\u20095). Subsequently changes in gait-parameters between those two groups were examined over time and over stimulation condition at T2, using 2-factorial mixed repeated measures ANOVAs (Group x time point (T1\n\n, T2\n\n); Group\u2009\u00d7\u2009stim (T2\n\n, T2\n\n)). F-values from any rANOVAs introducing the three-level factor gait-condition were Greenhouse-Geisser corrected.\n\nPatients\u2019 age ranged from 46.1 to 64.7 years with\n\n=\u200954.1 and\n\n=\u20095.5 years at the time of device implantation. The lesion occurred on average 5.8 (\n\n=\u20093.1) years before implantation, ranging from 1.7 to 12.0 years. Two patients\u2019 lesion occurred 2 and 3.8 years before implantation, respectively. Four subjects suffered from a cerebral damage within the right hemisphere while in 7 subjects the lesion was located within the left hemisphere. The first measurements (T1) for most patients were performed from two days prior to 5 days after the implantation. In three patients the first examination time point (T1) occurred 16, 38 and 177 days after operation, respectively. In nine subjects the second examination (T2) occurred within 82 to 139 days after T1. For two subjects the time between T1 and T2 amount to 191 and 366 days respectively.\n\nResults from the SF-36 subscores where highly consistent. A repeated measures ANOVA for the relative changes over time across the subscores did not reveal any significant differences in the change over time between the subscores (F(3, 30)\u2009=\u20090.94, p\u2009>\u20090.4), suggesting a high inter-item reliability. Quality of life improved significantly for patients from T1 to T2 as shown by the changes of SF36-subscores (all: t(10)\u2009=\u20094.06, p\u2009<\u20090.01; physical: t(10)\u2009=\u20093.04, p\u2009<\u20090.02; emotional: t(10)\u2009=\u20092.89, p\u2009<\u20090.02; pain: t(10)\u2009=\u20092.40, p\u2009<\u20090.05) (Fig.\n\n).\n\nBehavioral results. Gait parameters and SF-36 questionnaire across assessment time point and stimulation condition. Error bars depict the standard error of mean.\n\nOut of the gait-parameters (T1\n\n, T2\n\n, T2\n\n) the cadence showed significant differences across gait conditions (F(2, 20)\u2009=\u20098.75, p\u2009<\u20090.01). Post-hoc paired t-tests showed a significant improvement of the cadence from T1\n\nto T2\n\n(t(10)\u2009=\u20092.75, p\u2009<\u20090.02) and from T1\n\nto T2\n\n(t(10)\u2009=\u20093.27, p\u2009<\u20090.01). The increase in cadence from T2\n\nto T2\n\nfailed to reach significance (t(10)\u2009=\u20091.93, p\u2009=\u20090.082). Likewise steptime and stridetime values differed across the three gait conditions (steptime: F(2, 20)\u2009=\u20098.05, p\u2009<\u20090.012; stridetime: F(2, 20)\u2009=\u20096.36, p\u2009<\u20090.025) (Fig.\n\n). Steptime and stridetime improved from T1\n\nto T2\n\n(steptime: t(10)\u2009=\u2009\u22123.70, p\u2009<\u20090.01; stridetime: t(10)\u2009=\u2009\u22123.55, p\u2009<\u20090.01) and from T1\n\nto T2\n\n(steptime: t(10)\u2009=\u2009\u22122.91, p\u2009<\u20090.02; stridetime: t(10)\u2009=\u2009\u22122.69, p\u2009<\u20090.03). However those two parameters as well failed to change significantly from T2\n\nto T2\n\n(steptime: t(10)\u2009=\u2009\u22121.55, p\u2009>\u20090.15; stridetime: t(10)\u2009=\u2009\u22121.61, p\u2009>\u20090.13).\n\nSubsequently the relative change of those gait-parameters over time (T1\n\nvs. T2\n\n) was correlated with the individual descriptive variables. None of the parameters (cadence, steptime and stridetime) changed over time for different sex (r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.13, p\u2009>\u20090.7; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.09, p\u2009>\u20090.7; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.12, p\u2009>\u20090.7 respectively), side of the lesion (r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.41, p\u2009>\u20090.2; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.36, p\u2009>\u20090.2; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.37, p\u2009>\u20090.2) or age (r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.08, p\u2009>\u20090.8; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.11, p\u2009>\u20090.7; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.06, p\u2009>\u20090.8). Most importantly the change in gait-parameters over time cannot be explained by the amount of years since the lesion occurred (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.36, p\u2009>\u20090.3; r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.21, p\u2009>\u20090.5; r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.33, p\u2009>\u20090.3), the time between implantation and first measurement (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.23, p\u2009>\u20090.5; r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.16, p\u2009>\u20090.6; r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.20, p\u2009>\u20090.5) or the duration between first and second assessment time point (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.18, p\u2009>\u20090.5; r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.22, p\u2009>\u20090.5; r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.19, p\u2009>\u20090.5). The same holds true for the relative change in gait parameters over stimulation (T2\n\nvs. T2\n\n). The amount to which patients gait improved with active stimulation at T2 was also independent of the years elapsed since the lesion had occurred (r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.12, p\u2009>\u20090.7; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.02, p\u2009>\u20090.9; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.08, p\u2009>\u20090.8) and the time between assessment time points (r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.19, p\u2009>\u20090.5; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.47, p\u2009>\u20090.1; r(11)\u2009=\u20090.24, p\u2009>\u20090.4). Additionally, the initial gait performance at T1 was unrelated to the duration between the implantation and T1 (cadence: r(11)\u2009=\u20090.11, p\u2009>\u20090.75; steptime: r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.17, p\u2009>\u20090.6; stridetime: r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.16, p\u2009>\u20090.6).\n\nUsing MEG source localization, cortical reorganization from T1 to T2 was quantified as relative distance change of dipoles within the lesioned and non-lesioned hemispheres\n\n. Six patients showed a positive index, thus a larger displacement of the sensory hand area within the lesioned hemisphere across time (Fig.\n\n). In most of those patients this displacement occurred towards ventral according to the absolute dipole positions at T1 and T2 (Fig.\n\n). The qualitative source distributions for those subjects largely overlap with this observation, as the ipsi-lesional sources mainly show a ventral shift (Fig.\n\n). A larger shift of the contra-lesional hand area during the same time period (negative ECD-index) was observed in five patients. The direction of the shift appears to be more heterogeneous in this group (Fig.\n\n). First, the ECD_Index was correlated with the patient\u2019s descriptive variables. Similar to the previous correlation analysis regarding changes of gait parameters over time, the relative cortical changes over time were analyzed with respect to the same patients\u2019 characteristics. The plasticity index showed no correlation with gender (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.43, p\u2009>\u20090.15), side of lesion (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.09, p\u2009>\u20090.7) or age (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.43, p\u2009>\u20090.15). Similarly, the amount of time between assessment time points (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.24, p\u2009>\u20090.45), the time since the lesion occurred (r(11)\u2009=\u20090.42, p\u2009>\u20090.15) and the time between implantation and first MEG measurement (r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.12, p\u2009>\u20090.7) were all uncorrelated with the relative dipole displacement from T1 to T2.\n\nSource localizations.

Hemispheres are flipped in that the left side illustrates the lesioned hemisphere in all patients.\n\nSubsequently, the ECD-Index was correlated with the relative change of gait performances over time (T1\n\nvs. T2\n\n) and over stimulation at T2 (T2\n\nvs. T2\n\n) to determine the degree of which the relative plasticity of the sensorimotor cortices is related to the improvement of gait parameters by using the stimulator. Interestingly the general improvement of gait parameters over time was not related to the plasticity-index (cadence: r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.16, p\u2009>\u20090.6; steptime: r(11)\u2009=\u20090.26, p\u2009>\u20090.4; stridetime: r(11)\u2009=\u20090.18, p\u2009>\u20090.5). However, the similarity of gait parameters at T2 in the case of active and inactive stimulation (T2\n\nvs. T2\n\n) was highly correlated with the ECD-Index (more cortical reorganization within the lesioned hemisphere) (cadence: r(11)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.77, p\u2009<\u20090.005; steptime: r(11)\u2009=\u20090.76, p\u2009<\u20090.006; stridetime: r(11)\u2009=\u20090.77, p\u2009<\u20090.005) (Fig.\n\n). To further analyze this very interesting effect, we subdivided the 11 patients into two groups, with one showing higher plasticity effects ipsi-lesional (positive ECD-values: G1) while the other included patients with more reorganization effects within the contra-lesional hemisphere (negative ECD-values: G2).\n\nGait and localization. Correlation between gait performance and laterality of cortical plasticity. (\n\n) For G1 the gait performance did not decline, once the stimulator was turned off. However gait performance droped without active stimulation in G2. (\n\n) This decline was highly correlated with a larger dipole displacement in the contralesional hemisphere. The vertical barplots show the ECD-Index and relative gait performance at T2 for each single patient. (\n\n) The scatterplots display the relation between the ECD-Index and the change in gait performance at T2.\n\nFirst, improvement in gait was assessed using two-factorial mixed model rANOVAs with the within factor time (T1\n\n/T2\n\n) and the between factor group. In line with the previous t-tests, subjects showed a general improvement in gait over time (cadence: F(1, 9)\u2009=\u20096.73, p\u2009<\u20090.029; steptime: F(1, 9)\u2009=\u200914.41, p\u2009<\u20090.004; stridetime: F(1, 9)\u2009=\u200912.72, p\u2009<\u20090.006). Additionally, as suggested by the correlation analysis with the ECD-Index there were no interaction-effects with the between-factor group (cadence: F(1, 9)\u2009=\u20090.36, p\u2009>\u20090.5; steptime: F(1, 9)\u2009=\u20091.08, p\u2009>\u20090.3; stridetime: F(1, 9)\u2009=\u20090.75, p\u2009>\u20090.4).\n\nThe same rANOVAs with the within factor stimulation (T2\n\n/T2\n\n) and the between factor group revealed quite different results (Fig.\n\n). The main effect for stimulation was significant for cadence (F(1,9)\u2009=\u20099.30, p\u2009<\u20090.014) but failed to reach significance for steptime (F(1,9)\u2009=\u20094.46, p\u2009>\u20090.06) and stridetime (F(1,9)\u2009=\u20094.14, p\u2009>\u20090.07). Most interestingly the stimulation at T2 interacted with group for cadence (F(1,9)\u2009=\u200911.33, p\u2009<\u20090.008) and steptime (F(1,9)\u2009=\u20096.05, p\u2009<\u20090.036). This interaction effect stems from the improved gait parameter of cadence for T2\n\ncompared to T2\n\nin group 2 (t(10)\u2009=\u20093.93, p\u2009<\u20090.017) but not in group 1, for which the cadence does not differ between the stimulation ON and stimulation OFF conditions (t(10)\u2009=\u2009\u22120.26, p\u2009>\u20090.8).\n\nThe present study investigated the neural correlates of motor improvements associated with the usage of an implanted active prosthesis in patients with drop-foot following brain lesions. Typically, these patients have trouble to walk and fall down often due to the inability to lift the foot. The prosthesis consists of a switch that is usually placed in a sock under the heel, a central control unit and an implantable device that performs electrical stimulation over the peroneal nerve. In short, depending on the setup the switch triggers the electrical stimulation either when the heel is lifted or when it touches the ground and the foot is lifted due to the muscular contraction of the tibialis anterior and peroneal muscles. A common observation in patients is, that they constantly improve or adapt their gait to the action of the prosthesis in the first weeks following implantation. Changes in the activity of the tibialis anterior can be linked directly to efferent changes in the central nervous system, as electrophysiological signals of the somatosensory cortex and signals of the proximal muscle fibers are highly coherent during gait\n\n. This link is impaired in stroke patients\n\n.\n\nHere we employed magnetencephalography in conjunction with somatosensory stimulation of the hand in order to map the hand representation in the primary somatosensory cortex around the time of the implantation and about three to four months later, during which the patients improved their gait using the active prosthesis. Given that in most patients the foot representation in the somatosensory cortex was damaged, sensory evoked fields related to foot stimulation exhibited signal-to-noise-ratios that prevented any reasonable mapping of the foot representation within the somatosensory cortex. The idea was that plastic changes in the somatosensory representation of the foot due to walking with the active prosthesis would affect the representation of the hand and shift it towards ventral and lateral. All patients showed improved gait with the active prosthesis after three to four months. Patients exhibiting plastic changes predominantly within the lesioned hemisphere during that time exhibited gait improvements that did not decline when the prosthesis was inactive. Patients with predominantly contralesional plastic changes also improved; however their gait performance worsened when the prosthesis was turned off.\n\nIn the literature motor recovery processes after stroke are divided into an acute/sub-acute phase of about 6 months which is characterized by changes in the functional organization paralleled by clinical improvement and a chronic phase (not later than 12 months after the lesion) during which only little improvement of clinical measures occurs\n\n. Changes in cortical plasticity patterns during the sub-acute stage assessed with fMRI\n\nwere shown to decrease considerably towards the onset of the chronic stage\n\n. Importantly the current study draws a very different picture. Here, the lesion leading to the drop-foot occurred more than 2 years ago in all patients. The observed plastic changes argue strongly that the functional electric stimulation (FES) due to the active prosthesis triggers neural plasticity in chronic phase patients. The results confirm previous reports of therapeutic improvements of gait after FES-training in chronic stroke patients\n\nand provide strong evidence for cortical reorganization processes also in this phase that are linked to an improvement of clinical parameters.\n\nWe observed two types of functional reorganization in our patients. One group of patients showed changes in the functional representation of the hand in the sensorimotor cortex predominantly in the ipsilesional hemisphere. The representation moved towards ventral and lateral. In these patients the gait improvement persisted when the active prosthesis was inactive. After about 3 months of daily use of the active prosthesis most parameters like cadence or stride length were improved and importantly did not change much between the ON and the OFF condition. This clearly indicates that the usage of the prosthesis had a clear therapeutic effect\n\nin this patient group. The second group of patients showed changes in the functional representation of the hand predominantly in the contralesional hemisphere. In these patients there was also a considerable improvement of the gait parameters after about 3 months, however, when the active prosthesis was turned off the gait parameters immediately declined. This was indicated by clear differences in cadence between the ON and the OFF condition at the second measurement time point.\n\nPrevious studies employing electrophysiological measures reported large changes in the sensorimotor representations of stroke patients resulting in a hemispheric asymmetry during their acute and sub-acute stage. The asymmetry was mainly caused by displacements of the representation within the lesioned hemisphere\n\n. Interestingly, higher asymmetries during the first weeks after the stroke were related to better prospective motor-recovery rates\n\n. Functional imaging studies largely confirmed these results. A common measure to assess cortical hemispheric recruitment in stroke patients is the relative laterality of sensorimotor cortex (SMC) strength\n\n. Longitudinal studies tracing patients during their acute stage consistently found an increase of laterality, thus a refocusing from bilateral SMC activity towards the ipsilesional SMC\n\n. Importantly, fully recovered patients showed a larger focusing on the ipsilesional side\n\n. This is fully in line with our findings in the patients who improved and maintained the level of improvement when the prosthesis was turned off. The change in cortical representation of the hand was towards ventral and lateral, which is also consistent with previous reports\n\n. It is assumed that after an initial recruitment of bilateral SMC shortly after the stroke to compensate for the lesion, a perilesional spread of the damaged representation into adjacent topographical maps occurs\n\n. This process of intrahemispheric reorganization is largely dependent on implicit, repetitive motor-learning\n\n. It appears reasonable to assume that active prosthesis-assisted walking triggered such reorganization processes in this patient group.\n\nThe second group of patients did not maintain their level of behavioral improvement when the prosthesis was turned off. Plastic changes in the SMC of this group was much less lateralized and, if at all, more prominent in the contralesional hemisphere. This finding is also fully consistent with the literature. Functional imaging studies suggest that patients with persistent bilateral SMC recruitment\n\nseize to show large improvements in motor recovery\n\n. In these patients the initial bilateral activation patterns to compensate for the lost sensorimotor networks appear to solidify. Importantly, these patients also learn to use the active prosthesis but cannot restore gait-patterns without the active prosthesis.\n\nThis study exhibits the underlying neural mechanisms of improved motor functions after walking with an active prosthesis in upper motor lesion patients. It provides evidence that cortical reorganization processes can be reinitialized in chronic patients using such devices and potentially improve motor functionality. Even when device-assisted walking does not induce specific reorganization processes within the lesioned hemisphere, the gait is still improved with the active prosthesis. Future research in a larger group of patients is needed in order to find out how stable the behavioral improvement remains over time in patients when the active prosthesis is turned off. If the effect is stable, then gait analysis could be used to guide the choice of the active prosthesis. Unless there are other important medical reasons for an implantable device (such as for the patients in the current study) all patients could first receive a non-implantable active prosthesis. Patients who maintain gait improvements for a longer time after the device is turned off would probably not need an implantable device. Patients in whom the gait improvements rely on the activity of the device would benefit more from the implantable one.\n\nThe datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\n\n"

    "full_text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is one of the most significant infectious diseases in animals\nworldwide [\n\n], and its prevention and control is thus\nof great concern for animal health authorities. In Japan, a large-scale FMD epidemic occurred\nin 2010 [\n\n], in which control measures including\nculling of animals on the detected farms; restricting movement of livestock animals, animal\nproducts and other contaminated commodities; and strengthening of biosecurity measures on\nfarms were employed. However, within one month after detection, the disease had spread so\nrapidly that emergency vaccination was performed, and the epidemic was contained. During the\nthree-month epidemic, 292 infected farms were detected, and almost 290,000 animals were\nculled. Introduction of the disease in an area densely populated with cattle and pigs is\nconsidered as one of the causes of rapid and extensive spreading of FMD [\n\n,\n\n].\n\nDifficulties in preventing the spread of the disease in highly dense livestock areas were\nalso reported in the previous FMD outbreaks in the United Kingdom (U.K.), the Netherlands and\nKorea [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n]. Whereas epidemics in European countries primarily\nentailed the infection of cattle and sheep, FMD epidemics in Korea and in Japan occurred in\ncattle and pigs. During the epidemic in Korea in 2010\u20132011, the invasion of FMD into highly\npopulated cattle and pig areas caused the widespread dissemination of the disease [\n\n]. Because the susceptibility and transmissibility of FMD\nare different between animal species [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n], the patterns\nof FMD epidemics depend on the predominant livestock species in the area where the disease\noccurs. Therefore, the features of the species and the population density of susceptible\nanimals in the affected area should be considered when developing effective FMD control\nmeasures.\n\nQuantitative modeling is a useful approach for evaluating the spread and control of disease.\nThe effects of livestock population density on epidemic size have been examined using a\nmodeling approach for FMD [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n], classical swine fever\n[\n\n,\n\n] and\navian influenza [\n\n,\n\n]. Furthermore, the previous modeling studies suggested that densely populated\nareas were at higher risk for large-scale epidemics than sparsely populated areas. Based on\nprior simulation studies, when the disease spread in densely populated areas, culling infected\nanimals on farms was insufficient for disease control, and additional control measures, such\nas vaccination or pre-emptive culling, were required [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n].\n\nTo select control measures that are suitable and appropriate for each region, it is necessary\nto understand the consequences of the epidemic and evaluate the effectiveness of control\nmeasures. In our previous study, an FMD transmission simulation model was developed based on\nthe 2010 FMD epidemic [\n\n]. The simulation results\nindicated that early detection of the initial case and prompt culling on detected farms\nreduced the epidemic size in the epidemic area. In addition, the results revealed that\npre-emptive culling and vaccination strategies had the potential to contain the epidemic in a\nsmaller scale. However, considering preparedness for future outbreaks of FMD, it is necessary\nto evaluate the risk of the disease spread and the effectiveness of control measures in\ndifferent regions, because livestock characteristics vary across the country and some regions\nare more densely populated than the areas affected by the epidemic in 2010.\n\nIn the present study, we evaluated the potential spread of FMD in major livestock farming\nareas with different characteristics of animal species composition and farm densities in Japan\nusing the spatial stochastic FMD transmission model to provide useful information for the\ndevelopment of FMD control strategies for decision-makers.\n\n: Considering the great economic damage to\nthe livestock industry caused by FMD outbreaks, this study assumed that an FMD outbreak\noccurred in a major livestock farming region in Japan. To evaluate the potential spread of\nthe FMD epidemic, three major livestock regions were selected based on differences in animal\nspecies and densities between the areas. In each selected region, the most densely populated\n100-km\n\nareas, defined as the central section, and the surrounding area of the\ncentral sections were selected as the simulation areas. Based on the pre-simulation results,\neach simulation area was arranged to allow enough size so as not to limit the possible\nspread of the disease. The distributions of farms in each selected area are shown in\n\n. Characteristics of the selected simulation areas are summarized as follows (\n\n).\n\nDistribution of farms in each simulation area.(A) the base area (BS area, 3,000\nkm\n\n), (B) the cattle and pig mixed production area (CP area, 3,000\nkm\n\n) and (C) the cattle production area (C area, 900 km\n\n). The\ncentral sections in each area were bordered with green (100 km\n\n).\n\n- The baseline area (BS) was the major FMD epidemic area in Japan in 2010, which was\ndensely populated with both cattle and pig. Cattle and pig farm densities in the central\nsections were 2.7 farms/km\n\nand 1.0 farm/km\n\n, respectively.\n\n- A cattle and pig mixed production area (CP) was one of the most heavily populated areas\nwith both cattle and pigs in Japan, in which cattle farm density was 7.2\nfarms/km\n\nand pig farm density was 0.6 farms/km\n\nin the central\nsection. Specifically, cattle farm density in the central section of the CP area was almost\n2.7 times larger that of the BS area. The surrounding areas of the central section also had\na high density of cattle and pig farms when compared to the BS area.\n\nA cattle production area (C) was a major area of dairy cattle farming in Japan. The number\nof cattle per farm in this area was larger than those in the BS and CP areas, where breeding\nbeef cattle was more prevalent. The median number of cattle per farm in the C area was 139\nanimals, while the median number in the BS and CP areas were 11 and 9 animals, respectively.\nThus, although the cattle farm density was smaller than the density in the BS area, the\ncattle population density in the C area was greater than the BS and CP areas. The pig\npopulation in the C area was low.\n\nFarm information, including location (latitude and longitude), number of animals and animal\nspecies in the selected areas, was used in the simulation of the disease spread. For the\nsimulation within the BS area, farm data collected during the 2010 FMD epidemic were used,\nand for the simulation within the CP and C areas, information from 2013 on farms in these\nareas was obtained from the database of the Animal Health Division of the Ministry of\nAgriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (MAFF) in Japan. Data from cattle and pig farms were\nused for the present study, because other cloven foot animals that are susceptible to FMD,\nsuch as sheep or goats, are minor livestock species in Japan.\n\n: An FMD transmission model developed for\nthe 2010 FMD epidemic in Japan [\n\n] was adapted to the\npresent study. The details of the transmission model are\ndescribed in the previous study [\n\n]. Briefly, the model is a\nspatial stochastic simulation model that replicates the spread\nof disease between farms. The between-farm transmission\nwas simulated using a transmission parameter called the\ntransmission kernel, which determines the infection hazard\nposed by an infectious farm to a susceptible farm as a function\nof the intra-farm distance (\n\n). Based on the model fitting\nof the four kernel function types to the epidemic data by the\nmaximum-likelihood estimation, the following function of\nthe transmission kernel\n\n(\n\n) was used in this study:\n\n: An FMD\ntransmission model developed for the 2010 FMD epidemic in Japan [\n\n] was adapted to the present study. The details of the transmission\nmodel are described in the previous study [\n\n].\nBriefly, the model is a spatial stochastic simulation model that replicates the spread of\ndisease between farms. The between-farm transmission was simulated using a transmission\nparameter called the transmission kernel, which determines the infection hazard posed by an\ninfectious farm to a susceptible farm as a function of the intra-farm distance\n(\n\n). Based on the model fitting of the four kernel function types to the\nepidemic data by the maximum-likelihood estimation, the following function of the\ntransmission kernel\n\n(\n\n) was used in this study:\n\nwhere\n\n,\n\nand \u03b1 are specific parameters that were estimated for the kernel,\n\nindicates the maximum value for\n\n(\n\n) at\n\n=\n0 and\n\nand \u03b1 determines the shape of the\n\n(\n\ncurve. By\napplying the transmission kernel, the force of infection \u03bb\n\n(\n\n),\nnamely the rate at which a susceptible farm\n\nis infected by\nan infectious farm\n\non a certain day\n\n, is then determined by:\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\nare the logarithmic number of animals on\nthe susceptible farm\n\nand the infectious farm\n\n,\n\nrefers to\nthe transmission coefficient, a parameter that accounts for\nthe species-specific transmissibility corresponding the animal\nspecies on the susceptible farm\n\nand the infectious farm\n\n,\n\nis the distance between the susceptible farm\n\nand the\ninfectious farm j.\n\nParameters of the transmission kernel and transmission coefficient were estimated by\nmaximum-likelihood estimation using the epidemic data during the period after the initial\ndetection of the disease until the implementation of emergency vaccination [\n\n]. Thus, the estimated parameter values of the\ntransmission kernel used in this study were\n\n=0.58,\n\n=0.00074 and\n\n=2.47. The relative\ntransmission coefficient for cattle-to-pig transmission (\n\n) was\n0.77, while those for pig-to-cattle (\n\n) and pig-to-pig\n(\n\n) transmission were 2.45 and 3.01, respectively, when the\ncoefficient for cattle-to-cattle transmission (\n\n) was 1.\n\nThe probability that the susceptible farm\n\nacquires infection on a day\n\nwas then given by,\n\nOnce animals on a farm were identified as infected, an affected farm was assumed to progress\nthrough the following states: latent (infected, but not yet infectious), asymptomatic\n(infectious, but no clinical signs), clinical onset, detected and culled. An infected farm was\nassumed to have an incubation period of 4 days (latent state for 2 days and asymptomatic state\nfor 2 days) [\n\n,\n\n]. On the basis of the median duration from clinical onset to detection during the\n2010 epidemic, the infection in a farm was assumed to be detected 4 days after the clinical\nonset. After detection, animals on infected farms were assumed to be culled within 24 hr,\nbased on the principal policy of the major FMD-free countries, including Japan [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n]. An infected\nfarm was assumed to remain infectious until the completion of culling.\n\nBecause the transmission kernel used in the present study was estimated based on epidemic\ndata after implementation of the movement restriction during the 2010 epidemic in Japan [\n\n], the disease spread under the movement restriction was\nmimicked by the simulation in this study. As the worst-case situation, the disease spread was\nassumed to begin in the central section, which is the most densely populated area in each\nsimulation area. Because FMD had already spread and at least 10 farms were estimated to be\ninfected by the time of the initial detection in the 2010 FMD epidemic [\n\n], 10 initially infected farms that start the disease spread in the\nsimulation were randomly selected from the farms in the central sections of each simulation\narea, and 10 different sets of initial infected farms were generated as the starting\nconfigurations. We ran 100 iterations for each set of initially infected farms, and a total of\n1,000 simulated epidemics were obtained for each simulation area. Every iteration of the\nepidemic ran for 100 days from initial detection of the disease, with each discrete time step\nequaling 1 day. Total numbers of infected farms and animals on day 100 were obtained as model\noutputs. The probability of containing the disease within 100 days, which indicates how many\nsimulated epidemics among the total 1,000 iterations fully ceased within 100 days, was\ncalculated.\n\n: The effectiveness of additional control\nmeasures, including pre-emptive culling and vaccination, was evaluated using the FMD\ntransmission model (\n\n). Based on the epidemic in 2010, the implementation of the culling strategy\nalone to target infected farms appeared insufficient to achieve prompt containment of FMD,\nonce the disease invaded the area more densely populated than the major epidemic area in 2010.\nTherefore, in the present study, evaluation of additional control measures was focused on\nmeasures to effectively and efficiently contain the disease in the CP area.\n\nIn the pre-emptive culling scenario, animals on all farms within a 0.5-km radius of detected\nfarms were preventively culled within 48 hr. Because the pre-emptive culling strategy has\nnever been implemented in Japan, the width of the pre-emptive culling radii was selected based\non the width used during FMD outbreaks in Korea [\n\n].\nFurthermore, epidemiological analysis of the 2010 FMD epidemic suggested that pig farms played\na significant role in the dissemination of the disease during the epidemic [\n\n,\n\n]. Therefore,\nto examine the role of pig farms in disseminating the disease, 2 types of pre-emptive culling\nstrategies targeting pig farms were evaluated in the current study. One scenario targeted only\npig farms within a 0.5-km radius of detected farms, and the other scenario targeted both\ncattle and pig farms within a 0.5-km radius of only detected pig farms.\n\nBased on the condition that the disease was introduced in an area densely populated with\ncattle and pigs, it was assumed that vaccination scenarios were conducted in the early phase\nof the epidemic, beginning on day 7 or 14 after initial detection, to allow adequate time to\nconduct a vaccine matching test and to arrange personnel and resources for vaccination. We\nassumed sufficient vaccine availability based on the vaccine stockpile policy of the Japanese\ngovernment. The vaccination capacity was also assumed sufficient for conducting all planned\nvaccination within a scheduled time. Vaccinated farms were hypothesized to be fully protected\n7 days and 14 days after vaccination of cattle and pigs, respectively [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n]. Farms that were infected\nbefore being protected by vaccination were assumed to be as infectious as non-vaccinated\ninfected farms. In this scenario, vaccination was applied in 5-km and 10-km radii around\ndetected farms. The 10-km radius was referenced in the vaccination program applied during the\n2010 FMD epidemic in Japan, whereas the 5-km radius was applied to evaluate whether narrowing\nthe vaccination range, which required minimal effort, had an effect on disease prevention.\nAdditionally, the effectiveness of joint control measures involving both vaccination and\npre-emptive culling was evaluated. The joint scenario included a vaccine strategy involving\nimplementation within a 10-km radius 7 days after initial detection, and the pre-emptive\nculling strategy that targeted only pig farms within a 0.5-km radius of detected farms.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of control measures, the number of infected farms and the total\nnumber of farms that were either culled or vaccinated were obtained as model output, and the\nprobability of containing the disease within 100 days was calculated. Also, as an indicator of\nthe workload necessary to complete the ongoing control measures, the maximum number of farms\nto be culled or vaccinated per day was estimated.\n\n: Three kinds of sensitivity analyses were conducted to\ninvestigate the influence on the disease spread, by altering the initial situations for each\nsimulation area. First, the number of initially infected farms was changed from 10 farms to 5\nfarms, 3 farms or 1 farm. Next, the effect of the prompt 24-hr culling policy, which required\nan infected farm to be fully culled within 24 hr after detection, was compared with those of\nthe 48 hr or 72 hr culling policy. Lastly, the width of the transmission kernel was changed in\norder to evaluate the effect of using the transmission kernel estimated from the previous\nepidemic area to other areas. To vary the width of the transmission kernel, the value of\n\n, which determines the shape of the\n\n(\n\n) curve, was increased 2 times or 4 times the initial\nvalue, which increases the transmission distance and the risk of disease transmission.\n\n: The epidemic size simulated under the 24 hr culling policy in each\nsimulation area is shown in\n\n,\n\nand the\n\n. Large-scale epidemics were confirmed in the high density\ncattle and pig areas, including the BS and CP areas, even under the 24 hr culling policy. In\nthe BS area, the median number of infected farms was 187 (5th\u201395th percentiles, 109\u2013238),\nand the median number of infected animals was 125 \u00d7 10\n\n(68\u2013159 \u00d7 10\n\n)\non day 100. Further, pig accounted for almost 90% of the infected animals (115 \u00d7\n10\n\n). In the CP area, which was more densely populated than the BS area, the\nnumber of infected farms and animals was greater and included an estimated 1,056 farms\n(13\u20131,465) and 315 \u00d7 10\n\nanimals (0.47\u2013460 \u00d7 10\n\n). Further, at the\npeak of the epidemic, approximately 20 farms were infected per day. Based on the median\nvalue, 86% of the infected animals were pigs (271 \u00d7 10\n\n). The probability of\ncontaining the disease within 100 days was 90% in the BS area under the 24 hr culling policy\nand 12% in the CP area. Conversely, the epidemic size was small in the C area, and infection\nonly occurred on cattle farms. The median number of infected farms was 12 (10\u201315), but the\nmedian number of infected animals reached 7.9 \u00d7 10\n\n(2.2\u201317 \u00d7 10\n\n),\nwhich was slightly smaller than the number of infected cattle in the BS area. All epidemics\nabated within 35 days (median value 16 days) in the C area.\n\nEpidemic curves in the BS and CP areas. Left column shows the infected farms per day,\nand right column shows the cumulative number of infected farms in the BS and CP areas.\nThe solid blue line in each graph indicates the median values, and the dashed blue\nlines in each graph indicate the 5th and 95th percentiles.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis examined potential impact on the epidemic size in each area by\naltering the parameter values used in the simulation model (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). Reducing the number of initially infected farms was less likely to cause\ndisease spread and reduced the median value of the number of infected farms on day 100 in\neach simulation area. The probabilities of containing the disease within 100 days were\nincreased compared with that of the original assumption in the BS and CP areas. However, in\nthese areas, the 95th percentiles of the number of infected farms were almost as large as\nthose in the original assumption when the simulation of the disease spread started with 5 or\n3 infected farms. Prolonging the days required for culling on detected farms leads to an\nincrease in the number of infected farms in both the BS and CP areas, but this change\nscarcely affected the epidemic size in the C area. As the width of the transmission kernel\nincreased, the size of the epidemic drastically increased in the BS and CP areas. An\nincrease in the number of infected farms and animals was also observed in the C area when\nusing the wider transmission kernels.\n\n: The results of the simulation indicated that the 24 hr culling strategy alone\nwas insufficient to control FMD in the CP area. Effectiveness of additional control measures\nwas therefore examined in the CP area, the results of which are summarized in\n\n,\n\nand\n\n. When farms within a 0.5-km radius of detected farms were preemptively culled, the\nnumber of infected farms was decreased to approximately 10% of the farms following\nimplementation of the 24 hr culling scenario alone (91, 11\u2013159;\n\n). If only pig farms within a 0.5-km radius of detected\nfarms were preemptively culled, the epidemic size was likewise reduced to a size similar to\nthe 0.5-km pre-emptive culling scenario. In these scenarios, more than 90% of the epidemics\nwere contained within 100 days. On the contrary, in regards to the pre-emptive culling\nscenario, only culling the farms neighboring pig detected farms did not effectively prevent\nthe spread of disease when compared to other pre-emptive culling scenarios. The total number\nof culled farms in each pre-emptive culling scenario was almost the same as that in the 24\nhr culling scenario (\n\nand\n\n). However, the maximum number of farms\nculled per day was larger in each pre-emptive culling scenario than in the 24 hr culling\nscenario, as the median value reached more than 70 farms in the 0.5-km pre-emptive culling\nscenarios targeting either both cattle and pigs, or targeting only pigs (\n\n).\n\n* Ratio of the median value in the control measure scenario to that at baseline.\n\n*Infected vaccinated farms that were culled after detection were counted;\nnon-infected vaccinated farms were not included. **Vaccination was assumed to be\nconducted within one day based on the schedule in each scenario.\n\nBox-plot of the total number of culled or vaccinated farms in each control measure\nscenario. The x-axis shows the abbreviated control measures as described in\n\n. The middle of the box is the median,\nthe bottom and top of the box are the 25th and 75th percentiles, respectively, and the\nends of the whiskers are the 5th and 95th percentiles.\n\nThe implementation of vaccination scenarios within a 10-km radius of detected farms on day\n7 following initial detection of the disease proved to be effective in reducing the number\nof infected farms (\n\n). The number of\ninfected farms in the vaccination scenario was 57 (14\u2013373), which was equivalent to 5% of\nthe number of infected farms in the 24 hr culling scenario. Additionally, 80% of the\nepidemics were contained within 100 days using the vaccination scenario. The 5-km radius\nvaccination on day 7 also reduced the number of infected farms to almost 15% of the 24 hr\nculling scenario. Although the 5-km radius vaccination on day 14 following initial detection\ncould not effectively prevent the spread of disease, the 10-km radius vaccination on day 14\nexhibited sufficient effectiveness to reduce the epidemic size to almost 20% of the 24 hr\nculling scenario. The total number of culled or vaccinated farms exceeded 1,000 farms in the\nmedian value in each vaccination scenario (\n\n). In all vaccination scenarios, the maximum number of farms culled per day was\nsmaller than that of the 24 hr culling scenario (\n\n). The median value of the maximum number of farms to be vaccinated per day nearly\nsurpassed 1,000, under the assumption that all vaccinations were conducted within the one\nday scheduled in each scenario (\n\n).\n\nThe combined scenario of vaccination and pre-emptive culling, which included 10-km\nvaccination on day 7 and 0.5 km pre-emptive culling targeting only pig farms, resulted in\nthe smallest-scale of epidemics among the control measure scenarios examined in this study,\nas the number of infected farms was reduced to 3% of the 24 hr culling scenario (31, 14\u201374\nfarms). Further, the combined scenario succeeded in abating all epidemics within 100 days of\ninitial detection, with a median epidemic duration of 51 days.\n\nIn the current study, the potential spread of FMD in three major livestock farming areas,\nwhich have different animal species composition and farm densities, was examined using an\nFMD transmission model. Results of the simulation model indicated that the difference of\ncattle and pig farm density had a profound impact on the spread of the disease. The disease\nspread more extensively in the areas densely populated cattle and pig (BS and CP areas).\nThis result suggests that areas with high density of cattle and pigs will pose a high risk\nof causing a large-scale outbreak, once the disease is introduced. Specifically, because the\nCP area had a higher livestock density in both the central section (the 100 km\n\narea where the disease simulation started) and its surrounding area than the BS area, a\nsevere epidemic was more likely to occur, with a high possibility that the epidemic lasts\nfor more than 100 days and reaches a total median epidemic size of more than 1,000 farms.\nConversely, epidemics in the cattle production area (C area) were effectively controlled by\nthe 24 hr prompt culling policy without additional control measures. Because the C area had\na low density of farms and fewer pig farms, the disease appeared less likely to spread\ncompared to the BS and CP areas.\n\nIn this study, the transmission kernel estimated from the 2010 FMD epidemic was applied for\nthe simulation of disease spread. Although the transmission kernel theoretically included\nall potential routes of disease transmission between farms [\n\n], the potential existence of other transmission routes that were not included in\nthe kernel could not be ruled out. In addition, disease transmission within a livestock\nfarming area could be influenced by farm management practices, movement patterns of animals,\npeople, or vehicles, farm bio-security and virulence of the pathogen. If the disease was\nintroduced into a dairy farming area that differed from the 2010 epidemic area, which\npredominantly included beef cattle farms, long-distance transmission of the disease might\noccur via frequent movements of milk tankers. To evaluate the effects of the density and\nother factors on the simulation outputs, we conducted a sensitivity analysis that increased\nthe transmission distance and the risk of disease transmission by changing the shape of the\ntransmission kernel, reflecting these uncertain effects. The results of the sensitivity\nanalysis indicated that as the transmission distance increased, the number of infected farms\nand animals likewise increased. In this condition, the median number of infected farms\nincreased by 1.6 or 2.4 fold in the C area, whereas it increased by four or five fold in the\nBS area and six or seven fold in the CP area, thus indicating that these kernels had a\ngreater influence on the epidemic size in the BS and CP areas.\n\nIn this study, the simulation of the disease spread started from 10 initially infected\nfarms based on the 2010 FMD epidemic. In the sensitivity analysis, the number of initial\ninfected farms was changed to investigate the influence on disease spread. According to the\nsensitivity analysis, a certain likelihood of causing widespread dissemination of the\ndisease remained in the CP area, even after the number of initially infected farms was\nreduced. The results imply that prompt culling alone could not achieve efficient eradication\nof the disease once the disease was introduced into areas densely populated with cattle and\npigs. This finding was consistent with the results of previous studies that suggested the\nnecessity for additional control measures in densely populated livestock areas [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n].\n\nThe simulation model demonstrated that the 24 hr culling policy was insufficient to\neffectively eradicate FMD in the densely populated cattle and pig areas, and therefore, the\neffectiveness of additional control measures, including pre-emptive culling and vaccination,\nwas evaluated. The 0.5-km pre-emptive culling strategy targeting both cattle and pig farms\nsurrounding a detected farm could prevent the disease spread more effectively than the 24 hr\nprompt culling scenario. Likewise, the 0.5-km pre-emptive culling scenario targeting only\npig farms around a detected farm exhibited equal effectiveness in controlling the spread of\ndisease. Furthermore, the pre-emptive culling scenarios succeeded in containing disease\nspread in 94% of the simulated epidemics within 100 days. However, the 0.5-km pre-emptive\nculling scenario surrounding only detected pig farms was less effective. The results imply\nthat prevention of and rapid, effective reaction to infection on pig farms are critical to\ncontrolling the spread of FMD and that once the disease is introduced into a pig farm, it\nmight be difficult to rapidly contain the disease spread in densely populated areas.\nTherefore, once an outbreak occurs in a densely populated area, the immediate implementation\nof control measures against pig farms is vital for preventing the spread of infection and\ntransmission on pig farms. However, some logistical problems exist, as the pre-emptive\nculling strategy requires more resources to cull animals due to the increased number of\nfarms to be culled daily. As an alternative to the pre-emptive culling strategy,\nadministration of an FMD antiviral agent to pigs may be an option for controlling the\ndisease [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n]. The FMD antiviral agent is known\nto have potent and selective anti-RNA-viral activity [\n\n,\n\n], but it has not been familiar with\nfor FMD control so far, in contrast to FMD vaccination, which has been sometimes implemented\nto control FMD outbreaks. Prior studies have shown that administration of antiviral agents\nto pigs during the early phase of the infection rapidly prevented the development and onset\nof clinical symptoms, and reduced viral shedding [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n].\nProvided the antiviral agents took effect within 48 hr of administration on a pig farm, the\nresults of the pre-emptive culling scenario targeting only pig farms could be interpreted as\nthe results of using the antiviral agents on pig farms surrounding the infected farms,\nthough it was a rough assumption. After the 2010 FMD epidemic, the Japanese government\nstockpiled a certain volume of the FMD antiviral agents as a precaution against future\noutbreaks [\n\n]. However, the antiviral agents have\nnever been applied in field, so further investigations are required to establish the\npractical use of the antiviral agents as a new option of the FMD control.\n\nThe emergency vaccination strategy in the early phase of the epidemic also exhibited\neffectiveness in preventing the spread of FMD in high density cattle and pig areas. When\ninitiated on day 7 following the initial detection of the disease, the 10-km vaccination\nmostly reduced the number of infected farms among the vaccination and pre-emptive culling\nscenarios evaluated in the current study. Nonetheless, it must be noted that even under this\nscenario, the probability of containing the disease within 100 days remained 80%, which\nimplies that the vaccination strategy was not entirely successful in preventing disease\nspread in the densely populated area. Generally, the vaccination strategy requires a period\nof time to allow for the induction of immunity in vaccinated animals, which was assumed in\nthis study to be 7 days for cattle and 14 days for pigs [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n]. Thus, there is a risk of spreading\nthe disease within or outside the vaccination zone before the vaccine takes effect, which\nmakes it difficult to accurately predict the results of the vaccination strategy. In fact,\nduring the 2010 FMD epidemic in Japan, 68 cases were confirmed after vaccination within the\nvaccination zone, and most of these farms are considered to have been infected within 7 days\nafter vaccination, i.e., before the vaccine became effective [\n\n]. In addition, during the 2001 FMD epidemic in the Netherlands,\ndespite the implementation of the vaccination strategy within a 2-km radius of infected\nfarms in the beginning, the vaccination area was expanded to cover the entire local affected\narea because of the rapid spread of the epidemic [\n\n,\n\n].\n\nAlthough vaccination within a 10-km radius on day 7 was nearly effective in halting the\nepidemic, the number of vaccinated farms reached more than 2,000, and the total number of\nculled or vaccinated farms exceeded that of the 24 hr culling scenario. Thus, it appears\nunavoidable that the vaccine strategy involves more animals than the prompt culling\nscenarios. If the \u201cvaccine-to-kill\u201d strategy was implemented, the government would face\nproblems dealing with the extensive loss of vaccinated animals. Conversely, if the\n\u201cvaccine-to-live\u201d strategy was employed, the government would have to increase efforts to\nmanage the vaccinated animals and their products, as well as implement serological\nsurveillance. Nonetheless, one of the merits to implementing the vaccination strategy is\nthat it would retard the spread of the disease. In addition, if the disease progress is\nsuccessfully abated by emergency vaccination, then the workload required for culling daily\noperations would be reduced, and the government would be afforded the opportunity to\nallocate limited human and material resources efficiently. However, at the same time,\nadequate logistical support for vaccination is essential for efficient implementation of the\nemergency vaccination strategy. As an indicator of workload, the maximum number of\nvaccination farms was estimated to be more than 1,000 farms per day, although this estimate\nseems excessive because of the optimistic assumption that all planed vaccination is\nconducted within one day with sufficient capacity. Actually, during the FMD epidemic in\n2010, vaccinations in almost 1,000 farms were completed within only four days owing to the\nnationwide dispatch of veterinarian and other stuffs [\n\n]. Therefore, resource management is important in planning vaccination\nstrategy.\n\nBecause of concerns regarding the possibility of failure to contain the spread of the\ndisease following implementation of the vaccination strategy, we examined the effectiveness\nof combining the vaccination and pre-emptive culling control measures. The combined control\nmeasure scenario involved the 10-km vaccination strategy on day 7 and the 0.5-km pre-emptive\nculling targeting only pigs. The joint strategy was the most effective among the control\nmeasure scenarios examined in this study in containing small-scale epidemics, as\nimplementation of the combined measures resulted in the abatement of all epidemics within\n100 days. The results following simulation of additional control measures also suggested\nthat devising intensive control measures, such as targeting high risk populations or\ncombining control measures, would be useful for effectively controlling FMD in the densely\npopulated area.\n\nThe present study demonstrated that the difference of cattle and pig farm density can have\na major impact on the spread of FMD and that additional control measures, such as\nvaccination and pre-emptive culling, have the potential to contain the epidemic on a small\nscale in areas densely populated with cattle and pigs. Because the characteristics of a\nlivestock farming area depend on its livestock density, diversity of species, and\ndistribution and aggregation of farms, it is important to develop an FMD control strategy\nsuitable for each specific area. In particular, it is necessary for national and local\nanimal health authorities to develop a practical plan to swiftly and appropriately apply\ncontrol measures against FMD; such plans should include how to manage human and material\nresources in an emergency, how to plan and perform the procedures of culling animals on\nfarms, and how to dispose of animal carcasses. Furthermore, considering the previous large\nFMD outbreaks in U.K. and the Netherlands in 2001 [\n\n,\n\n], once a large-scale outbreak FMD occurs,\nmassive culling of animals would be inevitable, causing large public concern in addition to\neconomic damage and psychological influences on livestock farmers [\n\n,\n\n]. Besides, as reported\nduring the 2010 FMD epidemic [\n\n], culling or\ndisposal operations cause mental distress among workers, such as veterinarians and livestock\ntechnicians. Therefore, in planning the control strategy, fostering the awareness of the\nimportance of prevention and control of FMD among relevant stakeholders, veterinarians and\nstaffs as well as the public also would be important, and it will help to smoothly gain\ntheir acceptance of control strategies, such as prompt culling, preemptive culling and\nvaccination, if an outbreak occurs.\n\nAs demonstrated in the current study, when planning an FMD control strategy, simulation\nmodels that can reflect the characteristics of the areas could provide useful information\nfor understanding the consequence of disease spread and for evaluating the effectiveness of\ncontrol measures. Meanwhile, it is generally important to remember that simulation models\ngreatly simplify real-world phenomena, and always involve uncertainty and limitations.\nTherefore, when interpreting the model outputs and discussing the results with decision\nmakers or stakeholders, it is important to understand the limitations of the model as well\nas the appropriate application. Nevertheless, despite these limitations, we believe that\nthese simulation exercises provide useful insights for the decision making processes, and\nfor establishing appropriate strategies to prevent and control FMD outbreaks.\n\n"

    "full_text": "Non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is a result of an acute imbalance between myocardial oxygen demand and supply, most commonly due to a reduction in myocardial perfusion.\u00a0Classically, it is thought that NSTEMI patients ultimately have a diagnosis of a non-Q-wave MI; however, 25% of patients with NSTEMI and elevated biomarkers go on to develop Q-wave MI in the weeks to follow [\n\n].\n\nNon-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome includes a clinical spectrum that ranges from unstable angina to NSTEMI. Nevertheless, it is recognized that this broad spectrum of clinical presentations and outcomes results from common underlying pathophysiology, with atherosclerotic plaque disruption and differing degrees of associated thrombosis and distal embolization. While patients with NSTEMI, in comparison with those with ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI), have a greater prevalence of early culprit coronary artery patency, they are also at higher risk of recurrent ischemic events [\n\n].\u00a0Patients presenting with chest pain or discomfort with suspected ACS require urgent evaluation. The clinical spectrum of NSTEMI may range from patients free of symptoms at presentation to individuals with ongoing ischemia, electrical or hemodynamic instability due to large myocardium in jeopardy, or cardiac arrest secondary to malignant ventricular ischemia [\n\n].\n\nTreatment for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), which includes STEMI\u00a0and NSTEMI, is often started in the emergency department (ED). About more than 90% of people with AMI receive emergency care [\n\n].\u00a0Although 60% of patients undergo same\u2010hospital admission, substantial portions are transferred between hospitals via the ED [\n\n]. Clinical outcomes from NSTEMI may be enhanced through the adherence to guideline-indicated treatments comprising of evidence-based pharmacological therapies and invasive coronary processes [\n\n,\n\n]. Several cohort studies have revealed that improving compliance with evidence-based interventions decreased the hazard of death after NSTEMI. Though, between and within European country variation in the delivery and outcomes from NSTEMI recommended that the possibility to diminish the prevalence and incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) has not been understood [\n\n-\n\n]. Measuring documented standards of care is a procedure by which geographic differences in the use of guideline-indicated treatments for NSTEMI may be addressed and, therefore, cardiovascular outcomes improved [\n\n,\n\n].\n\nRecently, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) reported the results of two programs of work that are central to the management and quality improvement of patients with NSTEMI. The first document, the \u20182016 ESC guideline for the management of acute coronary syndromes in patients without persistent ST-segment elevation\u2019, sets out the evidence-based road map for the optimal care of patients with NSTEMI. The second document, entitled \u2018Quality indicators for acute myocardial infarction: A position paper of the Acute Cardiovascular Care Association\u2019, details across seven domains and 20 indicators specific quality assessment indicators that include evidence-based process measures mapped to the 2017 NSTEMI guidelines and non-evidence-based dimensions important for quality improvement [\n\n]. External validation studies in the United Kingdom (UK) and France propose that most of the Quality Indicators (Qis) were meaningfully contrariwise correlated with 30-day and -year mortality that is, the greater accomplishment of the ESC standards of NSTEMI care is related to favorable clinical outcomes [\n\n,\n\n].\n\nMortality rates for NSTEMI are high and survival worse than that for STEMI. The incidence of NSTEMI, which is already higher than for STEMI, is increasing with the aging and co-morbid European population [\n\n-\n\n]. Moreover, the prevalence and dissimilarity of NSTEMI care and outcomes continue notwithstanding considerable enhancements in its management [\n\n-\n\n].\n\nNon-ST elevation myocardial infarction\n\nNSTEMI is an acute ischemic event causing cardiomyocyte death by necrosis in a clinical setting consistent with acute myocardial ischemia [\n\n]. The leading symptom that initiates the diagnostic and therapeutic cascade in patients with suspected ACS is chest pain but to make a diagnosis of NSTEMI, one major criterion is the typical rise and gradual fall in cardiac biomarkers (troponin or CKMB) in addition to one or more of the following [\n\n]: (i) symptoms of ischemia; (ii) electrocardiography (ECG) changes; (iii) imaging evidence of new or presumed new loss of viable myocardium or regional wall motion abnormality; (iv) intracoronary thrombus detected on angiography or autopsy.\n\nResearch justifications\n\nCardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death worldwide. Prompt recognition and initiation of appropriate management can save lives. NSTEMI is considered one of these top cardiac emergencies, carrying significant morbidity and mortality. This burden can highly be reduced by proper management and adherence to protocols and guidelines. The practice of evidence-based medicine is highly reliable on deep understanding and knowledge of demographics and patterns of the disease.\n\nThis is a prospective single tertiary cardiology center observational study conducted in the period from May to July 2021. All patients presented to\u00a0Alshaab Teaching Hospital during the period from May to July 2021\u00a0with a confirmed diagnosis of NSTEMI according to the ESC definition of NSTEMI and based on the universal definition of acute myocardial infarction during the study period. Total coverage of all patients with NSTEMI fulfills the inclusion criteria of the study. This study included 40 patients during the study period.\n\nData collection was carried out by the principal investigator. Data were\u00a0collected through structured questionnaires consisting of demographics, medical history, clinical presentations, laboratory investigation, Killip classifications, ECG, echocardiogram, diagnostic coronary angiography (CAG), management strategies, and medications used. Patients were followed up for 30-days to assess the outcomes in terms of surviving, readmission, and mortality. The study included all\u00a0patients aged\u00a018 years or above how their final diagnosis was NSTEMI presented to the center during the study period. We applied the Universal Definition of Acute Myocardial Infarction (type 1 MI) in the recruitment process. We only excluded the patients who refused to participate or do not fulfill the inclusion criteria.\n\nDemographic data, clinical presentation, duration of symptoms, risk factors, laboratory investigations: creatinine, hematocrit, vital signs, Killip classifications, baseline ECG, echocardiogram, diagnostic CAG,\u00a0final management strategies,\u00a0medications used, inpatient mortality, and\u00a030 days outcomes data were all included and reviewed for the targeted population during the study period.\n\nData analysis\n\nData were analyzed by using a computer program Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS V. 21.0, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). The analyzed data are presented in tables and figures designed by Microsoft Excel 2010.\n\nEthical approval\n\nEthical approval was obtained from Sudan Medical Specialization Board (SMSB) after being approved by the National Research Ethics-review Committee as part of the EURObservational Research Programme, NSTEMI Registry No. 2-4-19. Hospital administration\u2019s approval and informed consent from patients were obtained as well.\u00a0Data used anonymously by using identity numbers instead of names is ordered to protect the patient\u2019s identity and kept secure in a separate file. No reference to any individual participant was made in study reports. Subject identities were known only by the study staff.\n\nIn total, this study enrolled 40 NSTEMI patients, 27 (67.5%) were males and 13 (32.5%) were females, and most of the 24 (60%) were aged from 56 to 70 years (Table\n\n). Diabetes (n=24; 60%) and hypertension (n=20; 50%) were the major CVD risk factors encountered (Figure\n\n). Around 12 patients (30%) had prior MI, four (10%) had prior PCI, and three (7.5%) patients had a history of heart failure (Figure\n\n). Most of the patients had heart rate ranged from 60 to 100 bpm (n=37; 92.5%), systolic blood pressure ranged from 90 to 140 mmHg (n=33; 82.5%) and diastolic blood pressure ranged from 60 to 90 mmHg (n=34; 85%) (Table\n\n). Interestingly, 29 (72%) had late symptoms onset (>6 hours) and 11 (28%) had early-onset (<6 hours; Figure\n\n). Two patients (5%) presented with acute heart failure and one (2.5%) with arrhythmia or cardiac arrest (Figure\n\n).\n\nDM: diabetes mellitus\n\nMI: myocardial infarction, PCI: percutaneous coronary intervention\n\nHR: heart rate, BP:\u00a0blood pressure, SBP:\u00a0systolic\u00a0blood pressure, DBP:\u00a0diastolic blood pressure\n\nNSTEMI: non-ST elevation myocardial infarction\n\nWhen we applied Killip classifications to the study population, we found around 36 (90%) patients were Killip class I, and the remaining four (10%) patients were Killip class II (Figure\n\n). With regard to the laboratory investigations, the vast majority of the subjects 38 (95%) had creatinine levels ranged from 0.8 to 1.9 mg/dl, and all of them (i.e., 40 patients) showed positive troponin. The mean of hematocrit was 38\u00b15% and ranged from 32% to 45% (Table\n\n). As shown in Table\n\n, no patients in this study underwent risk score assessment during a hospital stay. All patients had sinus rhythm in their baseline ECG with 28 (70%) patients had T wave inversion, 10 (25%) had ST depression (5 in lateral lead, 4 in anterior and 1 in inferior lead), and one (2.5%) patient had right bundle branch block (RBBB; Table\n\n).\n\nECG: electrocardiography, RBBB: right bundle branch block\n\nAll of the study population had been offered an echocardiogram, however, only 36 out of 40 patients had echocardiography done during the hospital stay. Among them, six (16.7%) patients had LV systolic dysfunction (mild in two patients, moderate in three patients, and severe in one patient) with the median ejection fraction was 52% (ranged from 25% to 75%), and most of them 31 (86.1%) had EF levels >50% (Table\n\n). Diagnostic CAG was performed for 38 (95%) patients, 23 (58%) of them stented and 15 (37.5%) were not (Figure\n\n). The major final management strategy among our study group was PCI in 23 (58%) patients followed by medical therapy only without mechanical revascularization in 13 (32%) and coronary artery bypass graft in 4 (10%) patients (Figure\n\n). All patients received (n=40; 100%) aspirin, Clopidogrel, Parenteral anticoagulant outside the cath lab, and ACEi/ARBs. Moreover, 38 (95%) patients received statin, 28 (70%) PPI, and 7 (17.5%) received diuretics (Figure\n\n). There is overall good adherence to the 2017 ESC Guideline with exception of risk stratification (0%) during a hospital stay. All patients (n=40; 100%) were alive during the hospital stay and no in\u2010hospital mortality was found (Table\n\n). Regarding 30-days outcomes, 30 (75%) patients were discharged from the hospital, and 10 (25%) patients were readmitted (Figure\n\n).\n\nCAG:\u00a0coronary angiography, NSTEMI: non-ST elevation myocardial infarction\n\nThe aim of this study is to describe the characteristics, management, and outcomes of NSTEMI\u00a0in 40 patients attending Alshaab Teaching Hospital. In this study, NSTEMI predominantly affected patients aged from 56 to 70 years (60%), with a male-to-female ratio (2:1). These findings were in agreement with Sudanese studies of Mirghani\u00a0et al. [\n\n] and of Ahmed et al. [\n\n], where MI was reported mainly among males and patients aged above 50 years. Also, Chung and Ying reported NSTEMI was frequent among males (M:F=1.9:1) and older patients (mean age=64.3\u00b113.3 years) [\n\n].\u00a0In the same line, Saman and Arnoud noticed that NSTEMI was common in males (78%) and old patients (mean age=67 \u00b1 12 years) [\n\n].\n\nDiabetes (n=24; 60%) and hypertension (n=20; 50%) were the major CVD risk factors encountered. These observations were in accordance with a Spanish study in which hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia were the major risk factors found among NSTEMI patients [\n\n]. However, Hall\u00a0et al. reported smoking (ex or current) as the chief risk factor of NSTEMI [\n\n]. In general, as reported in the review of Ahmad and Mohammed, risk factors that increase the likelihood of NSTEMI includes, hypertension, DM, family history of CAD, smoking, hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and the previous manifestation of CAD as well as peripheral or carotid artery disease [\n\n]. On observations, most of the patients had normal heart rate (92.5%), systolic blood pressure (82.5%), and diastolic blood pressure (85%). Similar results were noticed by Hall et al. [\n\n]. Most of the cases in this study (72%) had a late presentation (>6 hours). This could be explained by a lack of community awareness of the illness and insufficiency of the prehospital services. Similarly, among the Sudanese population, Mirghani et al. reported 64% of patients had a late presentation [\n\n]. However, lowered duration between chest pain onset and ED arrival (median= 4 hours) was reported by Amsterdam et al. in Tunisia [\n\n,\n\n]. The present study showed that 36 (90%) patients were Killip class I and the remaining 4 (10%) patients were Killip class II. These findings were comparable to the study of Polonski et al. who reported 87% of NSTEMI patients had Killip classes I and II [\n\n].\n\nAs recommended by ESC [\n\n] and AHA guidelines [\n\n], initial risk stratification is important in NSTE-ACS to predict outcomes and treatment selection by directly visualizing treatable targets in higher-risk individuals, since the benefit of intensive therapies varies with risk. In this study, no patient underwent risk score assessment during a hospital stay; this calls for the emerging use of scoring tools such as GRACE and TIMI in our protocol. ECG changes are one of the criteria in the diagnosis of NTEMI; in the current study, all patients (i.e. 40) had sinus rhythm. Consistently, in the study of Polonski\u00a0et al., 91.2% of patients had sinus rhythm [\n\n]. The main ECG abnormality found among our study groups was T-wave inversion (70%). As reported in the 2016 ESC guideline, T-wave flattening or inversion are major ECG changes in NSTEMI [\n\n]. Also, in the study of Chung and Ying, T-wave abnormalities (65.6%) were the commonest ECG changes among NSTEMI [\n\n]. According to the recommendations of the 2017 ESC guideline, an echocardiogram should be performed on all patients during their hospital stay. In our study, 90% of patients underwent echocardiograms. Among those, 16.7% had LV systolic dysfunction (mild in two patients, moderate in three patients, and severe in one patient).\u00a0The median ejection fraction was 52% (ranged from 25% to 75%) and 31 of the patients (86.1%) had EF levels >50%. These findings were in agreement with National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry by Abbott\u00a0et al. in which the median EF was 51% [\n\n].\n\nThis study showed that diagnostic CAG was performed for 38 (95%) patients and a stent was inserted for 23 (58%) of them. Our findings were sharply similar to the study of Rogers et al. who reported 57.4% of patients had inserted stent [\n\n], higher than the study of Polonski et al. (29%) [\n\n], and lower than that reported by Saman and\u00a0Arnoud (78%) [\n\n]. These variations might be due to differences in protocols between studies. The major final management strategy among our study group was PCI in 23 (58%) patients. PCI is the preferred reperfusion therapy if it can be performed by an experienced cardiologist within 72 hours of the first medical contact [\n\n]. Our findings were greater than the Sudanese studies of Mirghani et al. (20.4%) [\n\n] and Polonski et al. (23.1%) [\n\n]. In other revascularization methods, CABG was received by 10% of our subjects. A comparable rate was reported by Saman and\u00a0Arnoud who found 17% of NSTEMI patients received CABG [\n\n]. All patients received (n=40; 100%) aspirin, Clopidogrel, Parenteral anticoagulant outside the cath lab, and ACEi/ARBs. These findings were in agreement with the recommendation of ESC and AHA guidelines [\n\n,\n\n]. In respect to 30-days outcomes, all patients survived but 10 (25%) patients were readmitted due to symptoms of angina. No in-hospital or 30-days mortality occurred, which is indicating there has been improvement in NSTEMI mortality rates over time. However, previous studies reported that, among patients with NSTEMI, in\u2010hospital and 30\u2010day mortality rates of between 5.2% and 13.1% and between 7.6% and 17.0%, respectively, have been reported [\n\n,\n\n].\u00a0In registries of Yeh et al. [\n\n] and McManus et al. [\n\n], the in\u2010hospital mortality rate was 7.1% in 1994 and 5.2% in 2006 [\n\n], and from a 30\u2010day mortality rate was 10.0% in 1999 and 7.6% in 2008 [\n\n].\n\nWe conclude that NSTEMI predominantly affected male and older patients, with a delayed presentation to ED. Hypertension and DM were the major risk factors. All patients were in sinus rhythm and the main ECG abnormality was a T-wave inversion. Most of the patients received standard NSTEMI protocol with exception of risk stratification. PCI was the major final management strategy used. No in-hospital or 30-days mortality occurred. We recommend that the initial risk stratification of all NSTEMI patients should be used and clearly documented. Sudan needs\u00a0ACS national registries (for both types STEMI and NSTEMI).\u00a0Education of the general population about ischemic heart disease and improving prehospital services would decrease the time to presentation. Finally, more prospective studies with a larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed.\n\n"

    "full_text": "The availability of technologies for spatial separation and processing of a large number of cellular clones is of utmost importance in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research [\n\n\u2013\n\n]. The goal of such technologies is to perform laboratory assays in a highly parallel fashion and at miniaturized scale so that clones from a population can be studied with high-throughput screening methods. Over the last two decades, several powerful strategies have been developed that allowed for high-throughput detection, analysis, sequencing and directed evolution of cells and their components [\n\n\u2013\n\n].\n\nIn the most widely used approach, clones from a population are compartmentalized in the wells of multi-well plates and each clone is individually analyzed using sophisticated liquid handling robot-stations. However efficient, this approach requires huge investments in terms of money, time and space, and imposes a throughput limit of ~\u200910\n\nvariants per screen [\n\n]. Over recent years, technologies that rely on man-made microcompartments have emerged as a valid alternative to conventional high-throughput analysis methods. Microcompartment-based technologies enable the further miniaturization of laboratory assays and provide significantly higher throughputs, which in turn permits faster exploration of higher library diversity [\n\n]. Microcompartments provide the perfect platform for evolutional studies: they enable high-throughput screening of spatially separated clones, while maintaining the linkage between the phenotype (the optical readout that originates from catalysis) and the genotype (the nucleic acid sequence that encodes the catalysts) [\n\n]. This is an essential requirement for any directed evolution strategy.\n\nSince the pioneering work by Tawfik and Griffiths [\n\n], who first introduced the term in vitro compartmentalization (IVC), screening platforms that rely on single, double and microfluidic-based emulsion droplets as compartments have been successfully developed for several catalytic activities including polymerases [\n\n], hydrolases [\n\n,\n\n], oxidoreductases [\n\n,\n\n], lyases [\n\n] or transferases [\n\n].\n\nIn a typical experiment, protein catalysts produced by a single cell or via in vitro translation are co-compartmentalized within an emulsion droplet with a fluorogenic substrate. Substrate conversion to a fluorescent product allows identification of catalysts with improved properties based on fluorescence readout. In this process, the droplet boundary has the fundamental role of retaining the fluorescent reaction product within the emulsion droplet, ensuring a reliable screening analysis. This incurs, however, an inability to control the exchange of molecules with the surrounding environment. Thus, for instance, biochemical reactions that require the addition or removal of small exogenous substrates are precluded, and analysis of binding reactions is not possible. As a consequence, evolvable phenotypes within emulsion droplets are restricted to fluorescent proteins and catalytic activities for which a fluorogenic substrate is available. Moreover, if the catalyst involved is characterized by very low catalytic efficiency, the amount of catalyst produced by a single compartmentalized cell may be insufficient to generate a readily detectable signal output. This is especially true if low sensitive readouts (e.g. absorbance) have to be used [\n\n]. Cell amplification to colonies may be required to obtain increased levels of catalyst before the detection reaction is initiated. To date, only a few examples of cell proliferation within emulsion droplets have been reported [\n\n,\n\n] and, unless chemostats are used in the microdroplets [\n\n], the limited amount of growth medium and the accumulation of secondary metabolites in the droplets prevent high cell density cultivation. Furthermore, since enzymes are often expressed in the cells, they may not be accessible for substrates, unless those substrates are able to cross the membrane. In that case, cells must be at least partially lysed, which is difficult to achieve and control in droplet emulsions without disrupting the emulsion. Thus, control of the concentration of catalyst encountering substrate is often difficult or impossible.\n\nHydrogels are three-dimensional networks of hydrophilic polymers dispersed in a liquid. Due to their many advantages, hydrogels have attracted increased attention in the scientific community and have been used for many biological and biomedical applications including drug delivery, single molecule and cell analysis and tissue engineering [\n\n\u2013\n\n]. Unlike water-in-oil emulsions, the porous structure of hydrogels allows the exchange of nutrients and waste to support cell growth as well as reagents to perform reactions, while preventing cells or colonies from leaking out. Hydrogels can be modified to generate structures with novel functional properties. For example, the stepwise deposition of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes via layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly on the hydrogel surface has been used to adjust hydrogel permeability rationally [\n\n,\n\n].\n\nTo our knowledge, only one study so far has used hydrogel-shelled microdroplets surrounded with a polyelectrolyte coating for high-throughput enzyme screening [\n\n]. In this study, using a microfluidic device, the authors generated emulsion droplets containing agarose and alginate which enclosed a single cell, a lysis agent and the fluorogenic substrate. Breaking the emulsion in the presence of the polycation poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) followed by subsequent deposition of poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS) resulted in gel-shell beads (GSBs) which were successfully applied to perform directed evolution of a phosphotriesterase. Although the GSBs size selectivity enables exchange of small molecules with a molecular cutoff of ~\u20092\u00a0kDa, the enzymatic reaction was conducted within emulsion droplets and relied on the compartmentalized fluorogenic substrate. The function of the polyelectrolyte shell was limited to retaining the fluorescent reaction product and to \u201cimmortalizing\u201d emulsion droplets that could be screened by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). In our work, we extend this approach and report on the development of a novel microcompartment-based method for high-throughput screening of phenotypes that require the addition or removal of small molecule substrates. The core of the technology is the use of hollow-core polyelectrolyte-coated chitosan alginate microcapsules (HC-PCAMs) with a diameter of ~\u2009360\u00a0\u00b5m and a volume of ~\u200925\u00a0nl. HC-PCAMs combine the advantages of hydrogel microcapsules for spatial separation and cultivation of cellular clones with the polyelectrolyte layer-by-layer technology for rational adjustment of microcapsule permeability. We show that single\n\ncells can be encapsulated, grown to high cell density and lysed within HC-PCAMs to generate monoclonal cell lysates that are suitable for high-throughput screening using the Complex Object Parametric Analyzer and Sorter (COPAS). We show that HC-PCAMs have a size-selective permeability that allows exchange of small molecule substrates. We therefore demonstrate the feasibility of using colonized HC-PCAMs as reaction compartments using the transpeptidation activity of the bond-forming enzyme sortase F from\n\nas a model.\n\nWe prepared hollow-core polyelectrolyte-coated chitosan-alginate microcapsules (HC-PCAMs) in a four-step process (Fig.\n\na). First, alginate beads were produced by laminar jet break-up technology at a rate of ~\u20092500 beads/s. Next, the beads were suspended in a solution of chitosan. Adsorption of the positively charged polymer chitosan (cf. Fig.\n\nb) onto the negatively charged alginate leads to formation of a polyelectrolyte complex membrane at the surface of the bead of increasing thickness with longer incubation time [\n\n,\n\n]. After 2\u00a0min\u2019 incubation, the thickness of the membrane was ~\u200915\u00a0\u00b5m. Subsequently, the chitosan-coated alginate beads were treated with sodium citrate resulting in dissolution of the alginate gel core while the alginate and chitosan membrane remained intact. Onto these hollow-core chitosan-alginate microcapsules (HC-CAMs) we then deposited the polyelectrolytes PSS and PAH leading to HC-PCAMs. We used bright-field microscopy and COPAS to analyze the morphology and size distribution of HC-CAMs. Spherical microcapsules with an average diameter of ~\u2009360\u00a0\u00b5m and average core volume of ~\u200925\u00a0nl were obtained (Fig.\n\nc). The size distribution\u2014calculated by COPAS as coefficient of variation\u2014ranged between 5 and 10%, demonstrating that we achieved uniform-sized capsules with the procedure developed.\n\nPreparation and Structure of Microcapsules developed in this Study.\n\nSchematic representation of the HC-PCAMs preparation process.\n\nChemical structure of the polymers at neutral pH. G and M represent the guluronic and mannuronic acid blocks in alginate.\n\nMicroscopy image of a single HC-PCAM and schematic illustration of the polyelectrolyte shell composition\n\nIn a previous study, chitosan-alginate microcapsules prepared using similar conditions showed permeability to IgG (156\u00a0kDa, hydrodynamic diameter ~\u200912\u00a0nm) that suggested an average capsule pore diameter of ~\u20099\u00a0nm [\n\n]. Depending upon the subsequent application, a less permeable capsule wall may be required. Layer-by-layer coating with the polyelectrolyte pair PAH and PSS has been shown to reduce hydrogel capsule permeability for high-throughput screening applications [\n\n,\n\n]. We decided to test whether this approach could also reduce permeability of the chitosan-alginate microcapsules (HC-CAMs). We assessed the permeability of the microcapsules with two fluorescent molecules, a labelled peptide (FITC-LPETGE, ~\u20091\u00a0kDa) and green fluorescent protein (GFP, 30\u00a0kDa), by monitoring their diffusion out of the microcapsules by fluorescence microscopy. After 10\u00a0min incubation, HC-CAMs exhibited no fluorescence when analyzed by fluorescence microscopy, showing that they rapidly released both molecules in the incubation buffer (Fig.\n\na). On the other hand, HC-PCAMs obtained by coating HC-CAMs with a single polyelectrolytes pair layer (PSS/PAH)\n\nremained permeable to the small FITC-peptide but efficiently retained GFP (Fig.\n\nb,\n\n). The kinetic release profiles of FITC-peptide and GFP from HC-PCAMs showed that only ~\u200910% of the GFP diffused during 24\u00a0h\u2019 incubation while ~\u200990% of FITC-peptide was already released after 4\u00a0h (Fig.\n\nb,\n\n). These experiments confirmed successful deposition of PSS and PAH on the surface of HC-CAMs and demonstrated that microcapsule permeability can by controlled by deposition of PSS/PAH layers. The HC-PCAMs produced still allow small molecules (~\u20091\u00a0kDa) to diffuse across the polyelectrolyte shell but large molecules (~\u200930\u00a0kDa, hydrodynamic diameter ~\u20095\u00a0nm) are efficiently retained inside the microcapsules.\n\nPolyelectrolyte Coating modifies Microcapsule Permeability. HC-CAMs uncoated and coated with PSS/PAH were loaded either with FITC-peptide or with GFP. The release of the two molecules from HC-CAMs and HC-PCAMs was analyzed upon incubation in a Tris buffer solution.\n\nHC-CAMs loaded with either FITC-peptide or GFP exhibited no fluorescence after 10\u00a0min\u2019 incubation when analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. The scale bar corresponds to 200\u00a0\u00b5m.\n\nHC-PCAMs loaded with FITC-peptide exhibited no fluorescence after 24\u00a0h\u2019 incubation, while those loaded with GFP exhibited a strong fluorescence signal, showing that HC-PCAMs are permeable to FITC-peptide but efficiently retain GFP (\n\n). Kinetic release profiles of FITC-peptide (\n\n) and GFP (\n\n) in the Tris buffer solution from FITC-peptide and GFP-loaded HC-PCAMs respectively. Samples of buffer were taken at different time points (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24\u00a0h) and fluorescence was measured using a plate reader. Data were plotted against time and fitted using the exponential decay equation (\n\n) n\u2009=\u20092\n\nAmong the various applications of microcapsules, they offer the possibility to encapsulate single bacterial clones and individually study the physiology of each clone in a highly parallel fashion. We were interested in using the microcapsules for functional enzyme screening in directed evolution experiments and therefore investigated in more detail the suitability of the microcapsules for single cell encapsulation, cell proliferation and cell lysis.\n\nFor single cell encapsulation, we chose the widely used gram-negative model organism\n\nBacteria were suspended in the bulk alginate solution and hollow-core chitosan-alginate microcapsules (HC-CAMs) were prepared as described above. When cell-encapsulating HC-CAMs were prepared and transferred into the growth medium, cells proliferated to form colonies extended over the whole capsule core (Fig.\n\na).\n\nCell cultivation and lysis within microcapsules.\n\nMicroscopy images of HC-CAMs before and after cell growth. The scale bar corresponds to 200\u00a0\u00b5m.\n\nGrowth kinetics of HC-CAMs-encapsulated\n\ncells as a function of time. Data were fitted using the Gompertz equation.\n\nLysis efficiency of\n\ncells encapsulated in HC-CAMs was determined by cell viability upon treatment with increasing BugBuster concentration.\n\nBugBuster induced lysis efficiency of encapsulated\n\nin microcapsules with increasing number of PSS-PAH layers\n\nThe probability of encapsulating zero, one, two or more cells in a single microcapsule is governed by the Poisson distribution [\n\n] (Additional file\n\n: Figure S1a). Using a cell density of one cell per 25\u00a0nl (i.e. on average one viable bacterium per microcapsule) about one third of the microcapsules do not contain bacteria (empty capsules), one third contain a single bacterial clone (monoclonal capsules) and the remaining capsules contain two or more clones (polyclonal capsules). Because polyclonality may lead to ambiguous results during microcapsule analysis and screening, obtaining a high fraction of monoclonal microcapsules is highly desirable. This can be achieved by reducing the average number of viable bacteria per microcapsule. However, this will significantly increase the number of empty microcapsules meaning larger production volumes and longer processing times. This problem was addressed in a previous study, by enriching alginate microbeads colonized by green fluorescent\n\nfrom empty microbeads using COPAS [\n\n]. In our work, we found that colonized hollow-core microcapsules can be efficiently enriched by gravity separation, because of their higher density compared to empty microcapsules (Additional file\n\n: Figure S1b).\n\nWe quantified the number of viable cells per microcapsule by comparing the metabolic activity of the encapsulated cells with that of\n\ncells grown in suspension via an MTT activity assay [\n\n]. Metabolically active cells reduce the water-soluble yellow substrate MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide] to the water-insoluble purple product formazan. After dissolution in an organic solvent, the formazan formed can be quantified spectrophotometrically and the concentration is directly proportional to the number of active cells.\n\nAfter 24\u00a0h\u2019 growth at 37\u00a0\u00b0C, a single microcapsule can host on average ~\u20092.5 million cells, equivalent to a cell density of 1.3\u2009\u00d7\u200910\n\ncells per ml (OD\n\n\u2248\u2009650) (Fig.\n\nb). The high local cell density demonstrates that nutrients and oxygen can easily diffuse through the microcapsule shell.\n\nNext, we investigated whether the encapsulated cells can be lysed within the microcapsules without destroying the microcapsules. We treated the microcapsules with the detergent mixture BugBuster\u2122 (Millipore) and assessed lysis efficiency by quantifying cell viability with the MTT activity assay. Cell lysis is already efficient at a concentration of a quarter of the recommended concentration (0.25X) (Fig.\n\nc). Moreover, lysis is equally efficient in microcapsules coated with an increasing number of PSS-PAH layers (Fig.\n\nd), confirming the high permeability of the capsules for low molecular weight compounds. Microscopic inspection of microcapsules after cell lysis revealed that neither cell growth nor detergent treatment affected the integrity of the microcapsules.\n\nSortases are a family of bacterial enzymes that are responsible for attachment of secreted proteins to the cell wall via a transpeptidation reaction. These cysteine transpeptidases first recognize and cleave a five amino acid long sorting motif on the target proteins (e.g. LPXTG, where X is variable) to generate a thioester-linked acyl enzyme intermediate. They then catalyze the formation of a new peptide bond between the cleaved sorting motif (the acyl donor) and the free amino group of a cell wall component (the acyl acceptor) (Additional file\n\n: Figure S2a). In the last decade, the transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by sortases has attracted increasing attention in the scientific community and has been exploited for the site-specific conjugation of a variety of acyl donor and acceptor substrates. This process, also referred to as sortagging [\n\n] has been used for a wide range of biotechnological and biomedical applications including protein functionalization [\n\n\u2013\n\n], protein\u2013protein ligation [\n\n], protein immobilization [\n\n,\n\n] and cyclization [\n\n,\n\n]. However, the widespread use of sortases for sortagging is being hampered by the intrinsic low activity of this family of enzymes. The use of sortases for sortagging gained significance after the development of an enhanced version of the most active and best characterized sortase A from\n\n(SaSrtA) by directed evolution [\n\n]. Due to the very low activity, sortases from classes other than class A are not currently used for sortagging applications and, apart from SaSrtA, in vitro evolution of other sortases has not yet been reported.\n\nIn a recent work, we reported that sortase F from\n\n(PaSrtF) catalyzes the transpeptidation of peptides bearing the\n\nE motif (the SrtF recognition sequence is highlighted in bold) to N-terminally oligo-glycine modified molecules acting as acyl acceptors in the reaction [\n\n]. To demonstrate the feasibility of using HC-PCAMs as reaction compartments for high-throughput screening procedures, we used PaSrtF as a model and assessed whether the SrtF-catalyzed transpeptidation reaction could be assayed efficiently and reliably within microcapsules.\n\nFor analysis of individual microcapsules a fluorescent readout is required. We therefore used the SrtF recognition peptide substrate (LPQTGE) labelled at the N-terminus with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and adapted a previously reported product capture strategy [\n\n] that relies on a sortase enzyme harboring a glycine at its N-terminus. In the course of the sortase reaction the fluorescent peptide is covalently linked to the SrtF which serves as enzyme and whose N-terminus is the acceptor substrate (Additional file\n\n: Figure S2b).\n\nIn fact, in crude cell extracts containing recombinant SrtF, modified by the addition of a single glycine residue at the N-terminus (Gly-SrtF), SrtF is efficiently labelled in the presence of the fluorescent recognition peptide (data not shown). We investigated whether the same reaction could take place inside microcapsules containing lysates from recombinant\n\ncells. The permeability of the HC-PCAMs would allow the fluorescent recognition peptide to diffuse inside and take part in the sortase-mediated conjugation reaction while preventing Gly-SrtF and its transpeptidation product (~\u200922\u00a0kDa) from diffusing out. To this end,\n\ncells, harboring the plasmid encoding either Gly-SrtF wild type or the inactive variant Gly-SrtF-C195G (used as negative control), were encapsulated within HC-CAMs and grown to generate microcapsules in which the respective enzyme is expressed. Following coating with the polyelectrolyte PSS and PAH, microcapsules were treated with BugBuster to achieve cell lysis. Subsequently, the microcapsules were incubated in the reaction buffer supplemented with the fluorescent substrate to initiate the sortase-mediated conjugation reaction. After the reaction, microcapsules were washed to remove unreacted peptide substrate and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and COPAS. The workflow of the assay is schematized in Fig.\n\na. In comparison to microcapsules expressing the inactive Gly-SrtF-C195G, microcapsules expressing Gly-SrtF wild type exhibited a significant increase of the green fluorescence signal when analyzed by fluorescence microscopy (Fig.\n\nb) and quantitative COPAS analysis (Fig.\n\nc), indicating a robust and consistent conjugation reaction within the microcapsules. To normalize the activity signal (green fluorescence of the captured and retained peptide) against the lysed biomass, we stained the microcapsules with the fluorescent\u00a0DNA intercalating agent propidium iodide (PI) before COPAS analysis, which could be detected as red fluorescence signal. When the COPAS analysis was performed with the normalized signal (green/red fluorescence) the population of microcapsules containing the Gly-SrtF wild type was clearly separated from the population containing the inactive mutant (Fig.\n\nd, e).\n\nSrtF\u00a0transpeptidation activity can be assayed within HC-PCAMs.\n\nWorkflow of the HC-PCAMs-based method for the analysis of SrtF activity. (i)\n\ncells, harboring the plasmid encoding either the wild type Gly-SrtF (WT) or the inactive mutant Gly-SrtF-C195G (negative control), are encapsulated within HC-CAMs. (ii) Microcapsules are transferred into the growth medium to allow cells to grow to colonies that express the respective enzymes. (iii) Colonized HC-CAMs are coated with PSS and PAH to reduce the permeability and generate colonized HC-PCAMs. (iv) Upon cell lysis, the expressed N-terminally glycine-modified sortase is released from cells but retained within HC-PCAMs. (v) Microcapsules are then incubated with the fluorescent peptide. Due to the low molecular weight, the fluorescent peptide can permeate through the polyelectrolyte shell and initiate the sortase-mediated transpeptidation reaction. (vi) Upon washing, the unreacted fluorescent peptide is removed and the reaction stopped. The polyelectrolyte coating retains the fluorescent transpeptidation product within HC-PCAMs, allowing detection of sortase activity via fluorescence analysis. (vii) Microcapsules are incubated with\u00a0the fluorescent\u00a0DNA intercalating agent propidium iodide\u00a0(PI) and analyzed for fluorescence by fluorescence microscopy and COPAS.\n\nBright field (\n\n) and green fluorescence (\n\n) pictures of reacted HC-PCAMs showing successful conjugation and capture of the fluorescent peptide within HC-PCAMs expressing the wild type Gly-SrtF but not within HC-CAMs expressing the inactive enzyme.\n\nHistogram overlays of HC-PCAMs analyzed with COPAS showing green fluorescence distribution (sortase activity) of Gly-SrtF wild type (red) and Gly-SrtF-195G (cyan) populations.\n\nRed fluorescence pictures of HC-PCAMs after the addition of propidium iodide.\n\nHistogram overlays of COPAS analyzed HC-PCAMs showing the distribution of the two HC-PCAMs populations after normalization of the green fluorescence signal (sortase activity) for the red fluorescence signal (lysed biomass) obtained with propidium iodide\n\nTo verify that the method can be used to sort microcapsules based on different enzymatic activities, we mixed HC-PCAMs in a 1:5 ratio of Gly-SrtF wild type:Gly-SrtF-C195G (with Gly-SrtF-C195G being the inactive variant of SrtF). The microcapsules in the mixture were coated with PSS and PAH and the sortase-mediated conjugation reaction was performed. As shown in Fig.\n\na, the fluorescence microscopy and COPAS analysis of the sample with mixed microcapsules revealed two distinct populations. One population (~\u200918%) exhibited a significantly increased level of fluorescence (about one order of magnitude) while the second (~\u200982%) showed only background fluorescence. This result is consistent with the mixing ratio and shows that microcapsules expressing the wild type enzyme can be clearly distinguished from those expressing the inactive mutant according to the fluorescence intensity. Furthermore, this experiment demonstrates that the method can be used to enrich or sort specific clones from a library. In support of this result, we isolated members of the active population, recovered the plasmid DNA which was then transformed into\n\ncells by electroporation (\u201c\n\n\u201d section) and after plasmid isolation their identity was confirmed by DNA sequencing.\n\nHC-PCAMs behave as individual reaction compartments that can be distinguished based on enzymatic activity.\n\nMicroscopic (\n\n) and COPAS analysis (\n\n) of mixtures of HC-PCAMs (1:5 ratio of microcapsules with cells expressing Gly-SrtF wild type:Gly-SrtF-C195G) after 21\u00a0h\u2019 reaction with 50\u00a0\u00b5M FITC-LPQTGE. Consistent with the mixing ratio, the analysis yielded two well-separated microcapsule populations. Microcapsules expressing the wild type enzyme were clearly distinguishable from those expressing the inactive mutant.\n\nUnlike HC-PCAMs, non-coated microcapsules exchanged cell lysates and reaction products and yield a single population with an intermediate green fluorescence intensity\n\nOn the other hand, when the same experiment was performed with a mixture of non-coated microcapsules containing either bacteria expressing wild type Gly-SrtF or Gly-SrtF-C195G, the COPAS analysis yielded a single peak in which the wild type and the inactive populations cannot be distinguished (Fig.\n\nb). This result clearly shows that unlike non-coated microcapsules, HC-PCAMs behave as individual reaction compartments that efficiently retain the lysates and the reaction products, preventing their exchange between different microcapsules.\n\nThe successful application of artificial microcompartments for directed evolution of proteins requires that the phenotype exhibited by a protein remains linked to the genotype in order to retrieve the genetic information. This implies that the DNA molecule encoding the protein is retained inside the compartment throughout the duration of the screening procedure and is eventually recovered for protein variant identification and, if necessary, for additional rounds of evolution.\n\nTo recover the plasmids, HC-PCAMs were dissolved by treatment with a solution of sodium hydroxide. The treatment disassembles the polyelectrolyte complex shell and leads to dissolution of the microcapsule, liberating the enclosed DNA plasmid. The obtained solution containing the plasmid was then either transformed into bacteria for in vivo amplification (Fig.\n\na) or used for PCR to amplify the gene of interest (Fig.\n\nb). Both methods can be used to retrieve genetic information, but direct transformation of the plasmid into cells is considerably faster than PCR amplification and subsequent cloning. In addition, direct transformation does not pose the risk of introducing new mutations as can occur using PCR.\n\nGenetic information can be recovered from a single HC-PCAM.\n\nLB agar plate showing transformants after electroporation of isolate from a single microcapsule into\n\ncells.\n\nPCR amplification of the SrtF gene from colonized (C) and empty (E) microcapsules taken before (C\n\nand E\n\n) and after (C\n\nand E\n\n) the sortase-mediated conjugation, showing that the plasmid is not significantly exchanged between microcapsules. NC: Negative control (No template),\n\npositive control,\n\nDNA ladder,\n\ncolonized microcapsule\n\nTo verify that the plasmid is efficiently retained inside microcapsules and is not exchanged between them during the assay, we assessed whether the wild type SrtF gene enclosed within colonized HC-PCAMs could be amplified by PCR from the empty microcapsules also present in the sortase-mediated conjugation reaction. If the plasmid is exchanged between microcapsules, we would expect PCR amplification of the SrtF gene from both colonized and empty microcapsules. In fact, as shown in figure Fig.\n\nb, PCR products were obtained from colonized microcapsules but no significant PCR product was obtained from the reaction with extracts from empty microcapsules. This result demonstrates that HC-PCAMs efficiently retain the plasmid and do not exchange it during the whole assay duration. Most importantly, the plasmid DNA can be retrieved from the microcapsules for further processing.\n\nWe have developed an innovative high-throughput screening method that relies on the use of a novel type of polymer hydrogel microcapsule. Characterized by size-selective permeability, these microcapsules serve as miniature cell culture and reaction compartments suitable for high-throughput screening of bacterial cell libraries whose assay format requires small molecule substrates to enter or leave the capsule. We have demonstrated that such microcapsules act as individual evolutionary units that link the transpeptidation activity of sortase enzymes with a fluorescence readout. The capsule permeability permits a fluorescently\u00a0labelled peptide substrate to diffuse inside the capsule and take part in the sortase-mediated reaction; however, it prevents the sortase enzyme and the fluorescent reaction products from leaking out. Using a COPAS particle analyzer, we showed that clones can be analyzed with high-throughput (~\u200910\n\n/h) according to sortase activity, making the assay a powerful tool for screening sortase libraries in directed evolution experiments.\n\nThe method is compatible with bacterial cell lysate; however, it could be applied to different cell types (e.g. yeast, mammalian cells) and many kinds of protein expression systems including in vitro transcription/translation, cell display or cell secretion. Notably, the possibility to grow cells to high density within hollow-core microcapsules allows maximizing the amount of protein that can be assayed in a single microcompartment. Apart from fluorescence-based systems, this would enable downward extension of the dynamic range of screening methods that rely on less sensitive readouts (e.g. absorbance) thereby making enzymes accessible for directed evolution even if they show very low activity or detection exhibits low sensitivity. Furthermore, cell colonies immobilized in selective permeable microcapsules provide a new and efficient means for preparing biocatalysts that can be easily recovered and reused or used as biosensor agents.\n\nThe method extends evolvable phenotypes in artificial microcompartments to catalytic activities for which fluorogenic substrates cannot be made but which require the exogenous supply of small molecule substrates. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that in the presented format, the method might not be capable of screening enzymatic reactions involving molecules that can diffuse out from microcapsules. To prevent the leakage through the polyelectrolyte shell, reaction products have to be immobilized on a larger molecules or substrates yielding insoluble products have to be used.\n\nUsing different polyelectrolytes and different coating conditions, the layer-by-layer technology could be used to adjust the capsule permeability according to user needs to rationally control the diffusion of molecules inside and from microcapsules. This, in addition to catalysts, would enable the application of the method for directed evolution of binding affinities.\n\nThe method is robust, inexpensive and easy to scale-up. During each step of the procedure, microcapsules are processed in parallel, which facilitates manipulation without the need for automated systems. Based on our experience the procedure would allow processing and analysis of up to 10\n\nclones in 48\u201372\u00a0h. The throughput of the method could be further increased by reducing microcapsule size, allowing isolation of the microcapsules with fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) instead of COPAS. For instance, microfluidics systems have been developed that allow the generation of uniform alginate microbeads as small as 10\u00a0\u00b5m in diameter which encapsulate cells with high viability [\n\n,\n\n]. By adjusting coating conditions, HC-PCAMs might be prepared from microfluidics-based alginate microbeads, allowing screening and selection by FACS at rates of up to 10\n\nper hour.\n\nAlginate beads were prepared using the semi-automated encapsulator B-395 Pro (Encapsulator Biotech/Buchi). A solution of 3% low viscosity sodium alginate (no. A112, Sigma-Aldrich) was prepared in 25\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 7.8. The solution was centrifuged for 10\u00a0min at 5,000\n\nand filter-sterilized with a 0.22\u00a0\u00b5m membrane filter (steriflip, Millipore). The alginate solution was transferred into a 20\u00a0ml syringe and extruded through a 150-\u00b5m diameter nozzle into a gently stirred beaker filled with 20 volumes of 25\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH\u00a07.8, 50\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n, 200\u00a0mM NaCl, 0.1%\u00a0Tween 20. Uniform and monodispersed beads were produced at a rate of 2480\u00a0Hz (Amplitude\u2009=\u20095) with a flow rate of 3.12\u00a0ml/min and an electrode tension of 1080\u00a0V. Alginate beads were allowed to harden for 15\u00a0min, collected at the bottom of a 50\u00a0ml tube by sedimentation and washed/re-suspended twice with 20\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 7.8, 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n, 0.05% Tween 20 (40\u00a0ml).\n\nA chitosan solution (0.3% w/v) was prepared by adding low molecular weight chitosan (no. 448869, Sigma-Aldrich) to 25\u00a0mM sodium acetate pH 5.0, 200\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n. After 30\u00a0min of stirring, the pH was adjusted to 5.0 with glacial acetic acid and following centrifugation at 15,000\n\nfor 20\u00a0min the supernatant was recovered and autoclaved.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n(GC-CAMs) were obtained by adding alginate beads to two volumes of gently stirred chitosan solution and incubation for two minutes.\n\nGC-CAMs were collected in a 50\u00a0ml tube and washed/re-suspended twice with 10 volumes of 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n, 0.05% Tween 20 to remove excess of chitosan. Next, GC-CAMs were re-suspended with five volumes of the latter solution supplemented with 20\u00a0mM sodium citrate for 1\u00a0min to dissolve the alginate gel-core and generate\n\n-\n\n-\n\n(HC-CAMs). HC-CAMs were washed once with\u00a010\u00a0volumes of 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n, 0.05% Tween 20 to remove the sodium citrate.\n\nHC-CAMs were used as a template for stepwise deposition of the polyelectrolyte pair poly(styrene sulfonate) (PSS, no. 243051, Sigma-Aldrich) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH, no. 283223 Sigma-Aldrich). HC-CAMs (~\u2009100\u00a0\u03bcl settled volume, ~\u20093000 microcapsules) were transferred into 2\u00a0ml centrifuge tubes and incubated with five volumes (500\u00a0\u03bcl) of 2\u00a0mg/ml PSS in 0.5\u00a0M NaCl, 0.5\u00a0M CaCl\n\nfor 10\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 850\u00a0rpm shaking. Before proceeding with the deposition of PAH or of subsequent polyelectrolyte layers the excess polyelectrolyte was removed by three washing/re-suspension steps with ~\u200920 volumes of 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 (2\u00a0ml final volume) for 1\u00a0min and 850\u00a0rpm shaking. PSS-coated HC-CAMs were then coated with PAH by incubation into five volumes (500\u00a0\u03bcl) of 2\u00a0mg/ml PAH in 0.5\u00a0M NaCl) for 10\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 850\u00a0rpm shaking. Multilayered microcapsules were prepared by depositing additional layers of PSS and PAH with the same procedure described above. At the end of the coating procedure, the resulting\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n(HC-PCAMs) with one or multiple PSS-PAH layers were likewise washed with 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl2, 0.05% Tween 20 to remove excess PAH.\n\nSamples of HC-CAMs (~\u2009100\u00a0\u03bcl settled volume) were incubated with 500\u00a0\u03bcl of 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl2 0.05% Tween 20 (500\u00a0\u03bcl) either containing 2\u00a0\u00b5M of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled peptide (FITC-LPETGE, Genscript) or Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP, Uniprot:\n\n) with shaking at 600\u00a0rpm for 15\u00a0min. FITC-peptide and GFP-loaded HC-CAMs were coated with a layer of PSS and a layer of PAH following the procedure described above. In this case, both the two polyelectrolytes and washing solutions were supplemented with either 2\u00a0\u00b5M of FITC-peptide or GFP for the coating of FITC-peptide or GFP-loaded microcapsules respectively. The resulting FITC-peptide and GFP-loaded HC-PCAMs were re-suspended in ~\u200920 volumes of 25\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 8.2, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n(2\u00a0ml final volume) and the release of the two fluorescent molecules from HC-PCAMs into the incubation buffer was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. Kinetic release profiles of FITC-peptide and GFP from FITC-peptide and GFP-loaded HC-PCAMs, respectively, were obtained by measuring the fluorescence of incubation buffer samples withdrawn over a period of 24\u00a0h using a fluorescence microplate reader (Infinite M200, TECAN; Ex: 490\u00a0nm, Em: 520\u00a0nm). As a control, the release of the two fluorescent molecules was analyzed from microcapsules without the PSS/PAH shell.\n\nFor cell encapsulation,\n\nBL21 (DE3) cells harboring the plasmid of interest from cultures in the exponential growth phase were diluted to an OD\n\nof 0.1 with 50\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 7.6, 100\u00a0mM NaCl. An aliquot of this cell suspension was added to the alginate solution to achieve an average of 1 or more encapsulated cells per microcapsule. After mixing for 1\u00a0min, the alginate solution containing cells was transferred into a 20\u00a0ml syringe and GC-CAMs were prepared as described above. GC-CAM-entrapping cells were transferred into a conical flask filled with terrific broth medium (25\u00a0ml) supplemented with 20\u00a0mM sodium citrate to dissolve the alginate gel core and cells were grown for 20\u00a0h at 28\u00a0\u00b0C and 150\u00a0rpm shaking. The analysis of encapsulated cells which eventually developed into colonies showed that more than 80% of encapsulated cells survive the encapsulation procedure. Protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.2\u00a0mM IPTG for 20\u00a0h at 16\u00a0\u00b0C. After cell growth and protein expression, microcapsules were washed/re-suspended three times with 10 volumes of 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n, 0.05% Tween 20, before proceeding with the deposition of layers of PSS and PAH.\n\nCell growth kinetics within microcapsules were determined by evaluating the cell viability of encapsulated cells grown at 37\u00a0\u00b0C by using an MTT reduction assay [\n\n]. Microcapsules were taken at different time points and washed with 100\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n, 0.05% Tween 20 to remove traces of growth medium and possible\n\ncells grown in suspension. Samples of cell-encapsulating microcapsules (~\u200910\u00a0\u00b5l settled volume, ~\u2009300 microcapsules) were transferred into 1.5-ml tubes and the residual liquid was pipetted off. Microcapsules were suspended with pre-warmed LB medium (200\u00a0\u00b5l) and the MTT reduction reaction was initiated by the addition of MTT solution (20\u00a0\u03bcl of 5.0\u00a0mg/ml MTT in water) pre-warmed to 37\u00a0\u00b0C. Tubes were incubated at 37\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min and 1000\u00a0rpm shaking with the tube cap open. The liquid was pipetted off and the purple formazan crystals formed inside microcapsules were dissolved with DMSO (1\u00a0ml) by vortexing for 1\u00a0min. After 10\u00a0min, the absorbance was recorded at 550\u00a0nm using a spectrophotometer. The number of viable cells per microcapsule at each time point was estimated from a standard curve obtained by plotting the MTT assay activity of\n\ncells grown in suspension.\n\nLysis of\n\ncells within microcapsules was achieved using the detergent mixture BugBuster\u2122 (10 X, no. 70921, Merck Millipore). Cell lysis efficiency was assessed by evaluating the viability of encapsulated cells after the treatment with different BugBuster\u2122 concentrations with the MTT reduction assay. Samples of cell-encapsulating microcapsules (~\u2009100\u00a0\u03bcl settled volume) were transferred into 2-ml tubes and incubated with 25\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 8.2, 150\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\nsupplemented with BugBuster\u2122 (500\u00a0\u03bcl final volume) for 30\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 850\u00a0rpm shaking. Following three washing steps with the same Tris\u2013HCl buffer (2\u00a0ml) to remove excess detergent, microcapsules were transferred to 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes and the MTT assay was performed as described above.\n\nFor recombinant expression of sortase F with a glycine at the N-terminus, the core region of sortase F from\n\nKPA171202 (e.g. GenBank:\n\n, Uniprot:\n\n, from threonine 35 to alanine 217) was custom-synthesized by GenScript and cloned into a pUC57 vector. The gene was transferred to the expression vector backbone p7X yielding p7X-SrtF-Pa-strep [\n\n]. Site-directed mutagenesis PCR was then performed with Phusion HF DNA Polymerase (NEB) using the synthetic oligonucleotides\n\n-\n\n(5\u2032-GGAGATATACATATGGGCAGTACCACCACGTCAAGCACG-3\u2032) and\n\n-\n\n(5\u2032-CGTGCTTGACGTGGTGGTACTGCCCATATGTATATCTCC-3\u2032) (Microsynth). Following treatment with DpnI,\n\nXL1-Blue cells were transformed with the PCR reaction mixture to yield the expression vector p7X-Gly-SrtF-Pa-strep that encodes recombinant Gly-SrtF with a C-terminal twin-strep-tag under the strong T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Similarly, to obtain the inactive variant Gly-SrtF-C195G, site-directed mutagenesis PCR was performed over p7X-Gly-SrtF-Pa-strep with the synthetic oligonucleotides\n\n-\n\n-\n\n(5\u2032-AGCTATTGTGATTGGCTGGGATTACGTGAAG-3\u2032) and\n\n-\n\n-\n\n(5\u2032-CTTCACGTAATCCCAGCCAATCACAATAGCT-3\u2032) to yield p7X-Gly-SrtF-C195G-strep. The gene sequences in the expression vectors were verified by DNA sequencing.\n\nHC-CAMs\u00a0encapsulating cells harboring either the expression vector p7X-Gly-SrtF-Pa-strep or p7X-Gly-SrtF-Pa-C195G were prepared as described above. Samples of colonized microcapsules (~\u2009100\u00a0\u03bcl settled volume) were transferred into 2-ml tubes and incubated with 50\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 7.6, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n, 0.5X BugBuster\u2122 (500\u00a0\u03bcl final volume) for 30\u00a0min at 25\u00a0\u00b0C and 850\u00a0rpm shaking. Following three washing steps with the Tris\u2013HCl buffer (2\u00a0ml) to remove excess detergent, microcapsules were incubated with 50\u00a0\u00b5M FITC-LPQTGE in 50\u00a0mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.6, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n(500\u00a0\u03bcl) for 21\u00a0h at 25\u00a0\u00b0C. After the reaction, microcapsules were washed three times with 50\u00a0mM Glycine pH 9.5, 500\u00a0mM NaCl, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n, 0.1% SB3-14 (2\u00a0ml) for 5\u00a0min and 850\u00a0rpm shaking to remove unreacted fluorescent peptide and twice with 10\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n(2\u00a0ml) for 1\u00a0min and 850\u00a0rpm shaking to remove excess detergent. Following incubation with 10\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n, 0.1\u00a0mg/ml propidium iodide (1\u00a0ml) for 5\u00a0min and 850\u00a0rpm shaking, microcapsules were washed twice with 10\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n(2\u00a0ml) to remove excess propidium iodide and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy and COPAS.\n\nFluorescence microscopy was performed with an Olympus BX41 microscope. Non-filtered white light (bright field) was used to illuminate the microcapsule structure. Two filter sets that allowed for blue excitation and green emission (excitation filter at 480/20; long-pass emission filter at 510\u00a0nm) or green excitation and red emission (excitation filter at 535/30; long-pass emission filter at 580\u00a0nm) were used to analyze FITC and propidium iodide-based fluorescence, respectively. Pictures were taken using lenses with 10 X and 20\u00a0X magnification. Exposure times were 1/100\u00a0s for FITC-based fluorescence and from 1/2000s for propidium iodide-based fluorescence. Microcapsules were spectrophotometrically imaged with a COPAS Plus particle analyzer and sorter (1000\u00a0\u00b5m flow-cell) controlled with the Flow pilot software (Union Biometrica). Fluorescence signals were recorded at 510\u00a0nm, appropriate for the emission maximum of FITC and at 615\u00a0nm appropriate for propidium iodide [ex: 488\u00a0nm, photon multiplier settings (PMT green): 450\u2013650\u00a0V (PMT red): 450\u00a0V; gain factor: 1.0. The COPAS-device was operated at frequencies between 30 and 40\u00a0Hz; At least 600 microcapsules were analyzed. Data analysis was performed using the FlowJo software.\n\nTo recover the plasmid DNA, individual HC-PCAMs were collected with 1\u00a0\u03bcl of the buffer in which they were suspended (10\u00a0mM Tris/HCl pH 8.5, 10\u00a0mM CaCl\n\n) by using a pipette. Each microcapsule was transferred into a\u00a01.5-ml tube and mixed with NaOH (5\u00a0\u03bcl, 50\u00a0mM) for disassembly of the polyelectrolyte shell and microcapsule dissolution. Following 1\u00a0min vortexing and 5\u00a0min shaking at 1000\u00a0rpm, acetic acid (5\u00a0\u03bcl of 50\u00a0mM) was added to neutralize the pH and the sample vortexed again for 1\u00a0min. For plasmid transformation by electroporation, an aliquot of the sample containing the plasmid (4\u00a0\u03bcl) was mixed with 40\u00a0\u03bcl of electrocompetent BL21 (DE3) cells (CMC0016, Sigma-Aldrich) previously diluted 1 to 4 with sterile and ice cold glycerol (10%). Following incubation on ice for 1\u00a0min, cells were electroporated at 2.5\u00a0kV, 200\u00a0\u03a9 and 25\u00a0\u03bcF using a 2\u00a0mm electroporation cuvette in a Gene Pulser Xcell unit (Biorad). After the pulse, recovery medium (960\u00a0\u03bcl, no. CMR0001, Sigma-Aldrich) was added to the cells in the cuvette and the cell suspension was transferred into a 15-ml tube. After incubation for 1\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C and 200\u00a0rpm for cell recovery, the cell suspension was centrifuged for 3\u00a0min at 3,000\n\n. Cells were spread on LB agar plate and allowed to grow overnight at 37\u00a0\u00b0C.\n\nFor the amplification of the SrtF gene by PCR, an aliquot of the isolated sample (1\u00a0\u03bcl) from either colonized or empty microcapslues was mixed with synthetic oligonucleotide primers FX_SrtE-StrepTag.for (0.5\u00a0\u03bcM; 5\u2032-ATATATGCTCTTCTAGTACCACCACGTCAAGCACGAG-3\u2032) and FX_SrtE-StrepTag.rev (0.5\u00a0\u03bcM; 5\u2032-TATATAGCTCTTCATGCTTATTATTTTTCAAACTGCGGATGGG-3\u2032) (Microsynth), Phusion HF DNA Polymerase (3 units; NEB), Phusion HF Buffer (1X, NEB) and dNTPs (200\u00a0\u03bcM). The reactions were thermocycled using the following protocol: denaturation: 95\u00a0\u00b0C for 5\u00a0min; 14 cycles at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for denaturation (30\u00a0s), 61\u00a0\u00b0C for annealing (30\u00a0s) (decrease 0.5\u00a0\u00b0C per cycle) and elongation at 72\u00a0\u00b0C (1\u00a0min); 14 additional cycles were performed at 95\u00a0\u00b0C for denaturation (30\u00a0s), 53\u00a0\u00b0C for annealing (30\u00a0s) and elongation at 72\u00a0\u00b0C (1\u00a0min). PCR reactions were analyzed on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel.\n\nPoisson Statistics and enrichment of colonized microcapsules.\n\nShown is the probability that a colonized microcapsule is monoclonal according to the Poisson distribution. During cell encapsulation, the lower the average number of viable cells per capsule (\u03bb), the higher the probability that a colonized microcapsule is monoclonal (red). A low average number of cells per capsule leads to a lower fraction of monoclonal microcapsules (blue) and, in turn, to a higher fraction of uncolonized microcapsules.\n\nScheme of the gravity-driven separation procedure for the enrichment of colonized microcapsules from a mixture of colonized and uncolonized microcapsules.\n\nSortase enzymes catalyze a transpeptidation reaction.\n\nScheme of the transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by sortase enzymes. Sortases recognize the pentapeptide sorting motif (e.g. LPXTG here) on the target protein (acyl donor substrate); The cysteine in the active site of the enzyme performs a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon of threonine residue, breaking the peptide bond between the threonine and the glycine and forming an intermediate in which the enzyme and the target protein are linked together via a thioacyl linkage. The subsequent nucleophilic attack of the thioacyl linkage by the free amino group of an oligoglycine stretch of a cell wall component (acyl acceptor substrate) resolves the intermediate and results to the covalent attachment of the target protein to the bacterial cell wall.\n\nScheme of the intramolecular transpeptidation reaction catalyzed by an N-terminally-modified sortase enzyme. The glycine residue at the N-terminus acts as the acyl acceptor substrate that solves the intermediate in an intramolecular fashion. This enables the sortase enzyme to covalently capture the acyl donor substrate (e.g. a FITC-labelled pentapeptide).\n\n"

    "full_text": "In the past years, Confocal Raman Microscopy (CRM) has gained great interest as characterization technique for biological materials due to the high lateral resolution [\n\n]. Depending on the numerical aperture of the objective and the excitation wavelength of the laser, a CRM set up can reach a spatial resolution down to 250\u00a0nm [\n\n,\n\n]. The advantages of CRM are many since one can acquire a chemical profile of the sample in a non-destructive and fast way, without time consuming sample preparation and staining. The coupling of rapid high sensitivity detectors and the xyz-driven piezo scan tables with high precision have allowed CRM to become suitable for Raman imaging i.e. chemical spatially resolved profiling. This is very important when analysing heterogeneous systems like biological samples.\n\nPlant cell walls make the skeleton of the plant body and differ in their chemical and structural properties depending on species, age, environmental conditions and also position within the same tree/plant [\n\n\u2013\n\n]. The potential of CRM has been shown in many studies by revealing the spatial distribution of lignin [\n\n,\n\n] and other aromatic substances [\n\n], the location of carbohydrates as pectin [\n\n,\n\n], the orientation of cellulose in the cell wall [\n\n], conformational changes of proteins [\n\n], the accumulation of fats and waxes of the plant cuticle [\n\n,\n\n] and also minerals [\n\n,\n\n]. An extensive practical guide on Raman imaging of plant cell walls can be found in [\n\n]. Specific band integration of different functional groups serves always as a first univariate approach and visualizes approximately component distributions [\n\n]. In Raman spectra of plant cells, many of the bands are not sufficiently sharp and clearly separated and attributable to a specific functional group of only one plant cell wall component. Instead, they are often broad and overlapping. The overlapping bands of different components and the large amount of data in an image scan are often a limiting factor for classical univariate approaches and can be overcome using multivariate data analysis. Over the years, the most recurrent methods in multivariate image analysis have been Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [\n\n] and cluster analysis (hierarchical or k-means clustering) [\n\n]. PCA aims at the optimal description of the relevant variance in the original data set through a bilinear model based on principal components, i.e. uncorrelated variables calculated to capture the directions of maximum variance of the data set. PCA models allow performing a reduction in the dimensionality of the original data set, remove random noise and display relevant information about the pixel and spectral space of the image [\n\n]. However, small variations that do not contribute to main fluctuations in the spectroscopic signal, e.g. different molecular structures of the same molecule, different orientations or different steps in a molecular pathway, can be eventually masked if an insufficient number of principal components is used. Cluster analysis by contrast is a segmentation algorithm oriented to find groups of pixels with similar spectra, i.e. with similar chemical composition, but finding the right number of clusters is also complex [\n\n].\n\nSpectral unmixing algorithms also describe images through a bilinear model analogous to the Beer\u2013Lambert law [\n\n], but they define the necessary components using \u201cbiological\u201d meaningful constraints i.e. non-negativity and others, instead of orthogonality. The basic model of any spectral unmixing algorithm is described as follows:\n\nwhere\n\n(sized\n\n\u00d7\n\n) is the original data set that contains all the pixel (spectra) of the image,\n\nis the matrix of concentration profiles or coefficients (sized\n\n\u00d7\n\n) and\n\nis the named pure spectra, or dictionary matrix\n\nsized\n\n\u00d7\n\nelements), that contains the profiles of the pure components as a result of the unmixing process.\n\ncontains the related concentration profiles (or abundances) of each pure spectral contribution (\n\n) in the different pixels. The denomination and characters used to describe the matrices in the bilinear model in Eq.\n\nmay change among unmixing methods, but not the underlying model. Each pixel spectrum in a hyperspectral image formed by positive spectral features is in all approaches explained by a linear combination of the pure endmember spectra forced to positive values (non-negativity constraint). They are weighted by a set of positive coefficients, which design the abundance of each pure endmember signature in the reconstruction of each particular pixel spectrum [\n\n]. There are several unmixing methods applicable to spectroscopy but also to other fields [\n\n,\n\n]. Among them, Vertex Component Analysis (VCA), Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) have become quite popular.\n\nThe VCA algorithm has been used in monitoring cellular uptake [\n\n], in depicting the distribution of amygdalin in apricot seeds [\n\n], in giving insights into the plant cell wall structure [\n\n], in the selection of marker spectra of hyperspectral images of leafs in order to determine the pigment content [\n\n] or in unmixing optoacoustic data [\n\n]. VCA assumes that all pixels in the image are in a space (simplex of a determined order depending on the number of endmembers) defined by the purest components (vertices) called endmembers (EM) and that the affine transformation of a simplex is also a simplex. VCA has low computational complexity and needs the presence of pure pixels in the data to ensure the recovery of the correct endmembers. The data are projected orthogonally into the space given by the spanned endmembers. After each step, the extreme of the projection corresponds to the new endmember signature until the number of endmembers is exhausted. The sequential projections are made in such a way that the endmembers recovered are positive and the sum of abundances of compounds in every pixel equals one [\n\n].\n\nNMF has been successfully used in deciphering the complexity of samples in different fields including time resolved optical waveguide absorption spectroscopy [\n\n], astronomical spectroscopy data [\n\n], chemical agent detection by Raman spectroscopy [\n\n], fluorescence spectroscopy [\n\n], nuclear magnetic resonance data [\n\n], text mining [\n\n], facial recognition [\n\n], gene expression analysis [\n\n] and unsupervised audio-visual document structuring [\n\n]. In addition, NMF has also shown its potential in resolving spectra of Raman images of the plant cell wall [\n\n]. Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) describes the original matrix of spectral data through a bilinear model of non-negative constituent factors [\n\n]. Some NMF implementations contain the sparseness condition as an additional constraint [\n\n,\n\n]. NMF is an iterative algorithm that combines the endmember spectra in order to reproduce the original data set as accurately as possible, i.e. providing models with an explained variance as high as possible. The number of components needed (or rank) is defined by the user trying to establish a compromise between good data approximation (high rank) and low model complexity (small rank). The quality of the approximation of the product of the decomposed matrices\n\nand\n\nto give the original matrix\n\ncan be monitored by a cost function which can be the Euclidean distance between the single elements of\n\nand the reproduced elements by the\n\nmodel [\n\n,\n\n]. In contrast to VCA, the optimization of all endmembers is made simultaneously. The implementation of the NMF algorithm used in this work can also handle the presence of missing values in\n\n.\n\nMCR-ALS is an unmixing algorithm used in many diverse fields, such as image analysis [\n\n], environmental analysis [\n\n], protein processes [\n\n] and\u2014omics sciences [\n\n], but also on Raman data of plants [\n\n]. MCR-ALS is an iterative algorithm that optimizes\n\nand\n\nin an alternating least-squares way under constraints that provide chemically meaningful profiles [\n\n\u2013\n\n]. As for NMF, all components in the model are optimized simultaneously and the MCR model aims at describing the maximum variance of the original data set. The advantage of MCR-ALS is that multiple constraints can be added to the analysis. In image analysis, apart from non-negativity, the use of reference spectra, the incorporation of information of presence/absence of components in pixels (local rank constraints, [\n\n]) and, recently, constraints that may improve the description of spatial patterns in maps [\n\n,\n\n], can be taken into account. The number of components to be included in an MCR-ALS model can be decided by the user or be estimated by an auxiliary rank analysis method, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The MCR-ALS optimization of\n\nand\n\nis most often controlled by comparing the data reproduced by the\n\nmodel with a noise-filtered matrix\n\n, obtained from a PCA model using the same number of components as the MCR model. However, the use of this PCA-filtered matrix can be avoided and the MCR model can be optimized by comparing the\n\nmodel with the original experimental data. Usually, the PCA-filtering step is convenient because the removal of noise stabilizes the optimization process. However, in very few instances, where very minor components have to be retrieved or when the spectral overlap is extremely high among some components, the PCA filtering step may present the risk of excluding some relevant information that represents a very low percent of variance [\n\n]. Hence, it may be interesting using the algorithm with and without incorporating the PCA filtering step. Furthermore, the implementation of multiset analysis is also an option when having several related data sets and allows for the simultaneous analysis of all information of interest [\n\n]. In image analysis, MCR-ALS results can be used a posteriori as seeding information for other chemometric tools, such as segmentation methods, [\n\n], calibration tasks [\n\n] or super-resolution approaches [\n\n].\n\nIn this manuscript we have investigated the applicability of the three different multivariate approaches, namely VCA, NMF and MCR-ALS (with and without PCA filtering) for unsupervised unmixing (resolution) of Raman spectra acquired from different plant tissues and species. Raman mappings of microsections of spruce wood (\n\nL. Karst.) Spruce and\n\nhave been studied to include more homogenous tissues (wood) with secondary cell walls as well as different tissues and cell wall types (parenchyma, xylem), respectively. The aim was to compare the potential of the different algorithms, work out the influence of pre-processing (especially baseline correction) and the effect of the selection of other algorithm-specific input parameters.\n\nA 90\u00a0years old Spruce tree (\n\n(L.) Karst.) was harvested in the middle of July 2015 in M\u00fchlviertel (Upper Austria). The bark of the fresh stems was removed immediately to avoid diffusion of bark compounds into the cambium and wood cells, which may enhance burning of the sample during the Raman measurement (personal observation). Pieces were cut out of a stem disc from 130\u00a0cm above ground (breast height) comprising the transition zone between sapwood and heartwood (see Fig.\n\na). The blocks were trimmed and cut in 20\u00a0\u00b5m thick cross sections using a rotary microtome (RM2235, Leica Biosystems Nussloch Gmbh, Germany). The stem of a 30\u00a0cm tall wild type\n\n(see Fig.\n\nb) was embedded in polyethylenglycol (PEG 2000, Sigma Aldrich, Austria) following the protocol described in [\n\n] and cut in 3\u00a0\u00b5m thick sections. Afterwards, the embedding media was washed out thoroughly with Millipore water. The microsections were put on glass slides with a drop of water, covered with glass coverslips (0.17\u00a0mm thick) and sealed with nail polish, to avoid water evaporation during the Raman experiment.\n\nAnatomy of the samples from which the Raman datasets were generated.\n\nLeft: Disk cut from the stem of Spruce. Right: The zoom in the stem is based on the CH stretching integration Raman image of an annual ring with early\u2014(EW) and latewood (LW).\n\nLeft: Schema of the grown plant\n\n. On the right part, a CH stretching integration Raman image of a microsection of the stem is shown and the main anatomical parts are pointed out: xylem, cambium, phloem and pith\n\nRaman spectra from the native cross sections were acquired using a confocal Raman microscope (alpha300RA, WITec GmbH, Germany) with a 100\u2009\u00d7\u2009oil immersion objective (numerical aperture (NA)\u2009=\u20091.4, coverslip correction 0.17\u00a0mm) (Carl Zeiss, Germany). The samples were excited with a linear polarized (0\u00b0) coherent compass sapphire green laser \u03bb\n\n=\u2009532\u00a0nm (WITec, Germany). The scattered Raman signal was collected with an optic multifiber (50\u00a0\u00b5m diameter) to a spectrometer (UHTS 300 WITec, Germany) (600\u00a0g\u00a0mm\n\ngrating, spectral resolution about 3.8\u00a0cm\n\n, maximum and minimum error of about 4.8 and 2.9\u00a0cm\n\n, respectively) and finally detected by the CCD camera (Andor DU401 BV, Belfast, North Ireland). The maximum spatial resolution is given by r\u2009=\u20090.61\u03bb/NA, which for the parameters and confocal set up used is about 230\u00a0nm. The Control Four (WITec, Germany) acquisition software was used for the Raman imaging set up. For both samples, the laser power was set at 36 mW. For Spruce, an integration time of 0.13\u00a0s was used and one spectrum was taken every 0.5\u00a0\u00b5m. For\n\none spectrum was recorded every 0.3\u00a0\u00b5m and the integration time set to 0.18\u00a0s.\n\nData preprocessing was performed using the WITec Project Plus 4.0 software (WITec, Germany). Cosmic ray removal was carried out before any further analysis based on an intensity threshold set by taking into account spectral and spatial pixels adjacent to the pixel of interest. All spectra were cut to the spectral region from 300 to 1800\u00a0cm\n\nbefore background subtraction and multivariate data analysis.\n\nIn order to assess the influence of the background subtraction on the unmixing algorithm output, analyses were done for both datasets with and without previous background correction (based on fitting a polynomial of order 3 and performed in the WITec Project Plus 4.0 software). For Spruce, a rank of 4 endmembers with and without background subtraction was taken for all methods, whereas when 5EM were applied, only the comparison for background subtracted data is shown. For Arabidopsis, the results are discussed with and without background subtraction based on the VCA analysis. The comparison of all approaches on the Arabidopsis dataset is based on the data without background subtraction.\n\nDuring the last 4\u00a0years more than 10 different spruce and Arabidopsis samples have been measured and analysed beside many other different plant species. Thereof two Raman images have been chosen as the most representative and illustrative to show and verify the observed trends in performance of the algorithms and effects of pre-processing and number of endmembers.\n\nAll algorithms were tested with different number of endmembers and with and without background subtraction. The algorithm VCA was applied using the software Cytospec (v.2.00.01). Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) was carried out using the WITecPlus 4.1 Software. The number of iterations was selected based on the retrieval of stable results, being for both datasets a minimum of 100,000 iterations. Multivariate Curve Resolution-package GUI 2.0 for MatLab (MathWorks, USA) was used for all MCR-ALS analyses [\n\n]. In order to keep the parameters between methods as similar as possible, for MCR-ALS, non-negativity was used as a constraint in the concentration and spectral direction. Spectral signatures in\n\nwere normalized according to the Euclidean norm. The effect of a prior PCA filtering step was tested in the final MCR-ALS results for both data sets.\n\nTo compare analogous endmembers between different methods they were sorted according to the abundance map and endmember spectra similarity. Additionally, for control, the correlation coefficients between the endmember spectra given by VCA and all the endmembers of the other three methods were calculated.\n\nFor all methods and conditions, the lack of fit (LOF) of the model and the variance explained (r\n\n) by the model was calculated as done in [\n\n]. The expressions used are described below:\n\nwhere\n\nis the element of the original data matrix in row\n\nand column\n\nand\n\nis the residual obtained from the difference between the element\n\nof the original data set and the analogous element reproduced using the suitable unmixing model.\n\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient between pairs of spectral endmembers was calculated within a method to ensure that the correct number of endmembers was used (too high correlation coefficients could imply an unnecessarily high number of components). Correlation coefficients were also calculated between endmembers obtained with different unmixing methods to facilitate the intermethod endmember correspondence. The statistical analysis was conducted under MatLab environment (MathWorks, USA).\n\nA Raman image of Spruce, comprising earlywood and latewood (Fig.\n\na), was chosen to perform a first assessment of the performance of the three different multivariate methods on blind spectral resolution. All algorithms were first compared based on the results of non-background corrected spectra and 4 endmembers (EM) in the bilinear model (Figs.\n\n,\n\n). The abundance maps given by all methods (Fig.\n\n) recompose the wood tissue as the zones between the cells (cell corners and compound middle lamella with EM1 and EM2, respectively), the cell wall (EM3) and the cell lumen and/or cell wall (EM4). EM2 and EM3 are virtually identical for the three methods [abundances (Fig.\n\n) and spectra (Fig.\n\n)]. EM2 spectra reflect almost pure lignin (e.g. bands at 1600, 1660 and 1140\u00a0cm\n\n) [\n\n\u2013\n\n] between the cells and EM3 a mixture of lignin (see bands before) and polysaccharides (e.g. bands at 1121, 1095 and 380\u00a0cm\n\n[\n\n]), in the cell wall (Fig.\n\n). EM1 and EM4 are more different between the three methods. EM1 includes only the cell corner region in VCA (while in EM2 more compound middle lamella, Fig.\n\n, first row), and the endmember spectrum reflects again clear lignin bands (Fig.\n\n, EM1 red spectrum). The 4th endmember clearly reflects the lumen (Fig.\n\n). So VCA abundance maps reflect the most different regions compared to the other methods (Fig.\n\n), although correlation coefficients between endmember spectra are high (Additional file\n\n: Table S1A). For all other three methods these two endmembers are present at more than one region, EM1 in cell corner and compound middle lamella and EM4 in lumen and cell wall (Fig.\n\n). The distinction of the compound middle lamella in x-direction by the other methods in EM1 is reflected in the spectra by a band around 1095\u00a0cm\n\n(Fig.\n\n), known to be sensitive for cellulose orientation and high in the cell wall layer S1 and compound middle lamella in laser polarisation direction [\n\n]. EM4 abundance maps include in all approaches the lumen, although in different scale (white to dark grey) but in NMF and MCR approaches also the secondary cell wall (Fig.\n\n). All EM4 spectra have low intensity spectra and in MCR-ALS also intensity minima, which appear like inverted bands. This is reflected in a high negative correlation with EM1 (Additional file\n\n: Table S1A). In the case of NMF, neither the abundance map nor the spectrum are interpretable for EM4. Therefore, it seems that for NMF and MCR-ALS approaches either the rank is still too low or a baseline correction is needed to clarify the results, although the models explain 99.99% of variance and have a low lack of fit (0.92\u20133%) (Table\n\n). On the contrary VCA model statistics are inferior, but abundance maps and endmember spectra are sound and interpretable.\n\nUnmixing methods on early and latewood of Spruce without background subtraction and based on 4 endmembers.

Endmember spectral signatures corresponding to the intensity maps shown in Fig.\n\n: VCA (in red), NMF (in black), MCR-ALS without PCA (in blue) and MCR-ALS with PCA (in green). The spectra are normalized against the main aromatic band at 1600\u00a0cm\n\nexcept for EM1 and EM4\n\nSummary of the data analyses performed on both data sets\n\nThe effect of background subtraction was examined by applying all methods on the background subtracted Spruce dataset and keeping the rest of the parameters constant i.e. same number of endmembers (4 EM), number of iterations (100,000) or convergence criterion (Figs.\n\n,\n\n). All algorithms delivered three very similar components: cell corner together with compound middle lamella (EM1), the S1 and S3 cell wall layers parallel to the laser polarization direction (EM2), showing the microfibrils oriented with high angle with respect to the fibre axis, and the main cell wall layer S2 (EM3) (Fig.\n\n). VCA brought the lumen in the 4th endmember, albeit the rest of algorithms did not. So once again, VCA behaves most different from the others in (1) resulting in the most different abundance maps and (2) a clear endmember for the water filled lumen. The other three methods traced in EM4 the compound middle lamella and/or cell corners (Fig.\n\n) with typical lignin spectra (Fig.\n\n). EM4 is strongly correlated with EM1 using the NMF and MCR approaches (Additional file\n\n: Table S1B), as both endmembers represent lignin, but of different composition/structure (Fig.\n\n).\n\nComparison of abundance maps given by VCA, NMF, MCR-ALS without PCA and MCR-ALS with PCA on background subtracted Raman data of Spruce based on 4 endmembers\n\nComparison of multivariate methods on background subtracted Raman data of Spruce. Endmember spectra given by VCA (in red), NMF (in black), MCR-ALS without PCA (in blue) and MCR-ALS with PCA (in green). Endmembers are grouped following the column order given by Fig.\n\nIn general, the correlation coefficients between endmembers within each method increase significantly after background correction, although MCR with PCA preserves a higher difference (Additional file\n\n: Table S1B). Unfortunately, this higher difference is also reflected in \u201cartificial\u201d not meaningful spectra (green spectrum, EM3, Fig.\n\n), where neither the lignin nor the cellulose bands are recovered in their typical form.\n\nThe comparison with (Figs.\n\n,\n\n) and without baseline correction (Figs.\n\n,\n\n) clearly showed that removing the background eases to reveal differences in cellulose structure. The cell wall layers with high cellulose microfibril angle (S1) are described by one endmember after background subtraction (Figs.\n\nand\n\n, EM2). While the VCA abundance map displayed the S1 selectively, all others methods resulted in medium (grey) values in the S2 layer as well. At the same time changes in the aromatic composition are more difficult to track and overseen by VCA. In a next step the number of endmembers was increased to 5 to explore the potential if subtle compositional changes in cell wall composition could still be revealed.\n\nThe dataset Spruce was analysed by all three approaches with 5 initial endmembers and after baseline correction (Figs.\n\n,\n\n). The correlation coefficients within the methods for the case are displayed in Additional file\n\n. The first three endmembers (EM1, EM2 and EM3) are again distinguishing the three most different wood tissue parts (Fig.\n\n). Especially the first two endmember spectra become now very similar in the three approaches, and differences are mainly found for EM3, EM4 and EM5 (Fig.\n\n). EM4 is rather inconsistent in relation to the pixel intensity distribution (Fig.\n\n), but also to the endmember spectral shape (Fig.\n\n). VCA pictures mainly middle lamella (cell corner earlywood) with a lignin-like endmember spectrum in Fig.\n\n. NMF pictures a patchy cell wall with higher intensity at tangential and radial cell junctions and is composed of lignin in its majority and polysaccharides in minor amounts. MCR-ALS without PCA remits the cell corners (Fig.\n\n, EM4) with other type of lignin composition (shoulder at 1635\u00a0cm\n\n) (see Fig.\n\n, EM4). The most dissonant endmember is given by MCR-ALS with prior PCA (Fig.\n\n) with both the cell wall S2 and partially the cell corners and again a very \u201cartificial\u201d not interpretable spectrum (Fig.\n\n). As the related endmember obtained with no filtering is very minor in presence, it seems that such a contribution may have disappeared after PCA filtering. The last endmember, EM5, portrays the water filled lumen for VCA and NMF (Fig.\n\n), whereas by both MCR-ALS variants the secondary cell wall is displayed again. The related spectra are matched also two by two: VCA and NMF deliver a Raman signature of water and both MCR-ALS analysis carry spectra with cell wall bands, but again in an unusual \u201cartificial\u201d manner. Model statistics (Table\n\n) did only improve slightly for NMF and MCR-ALS approaches and got worse for VCA, although this approach gave once again the most interpretable results and spectra.\n\nComparison of multivariate methods on Raman data of Spruce with 5 endmembers and previous background subtraction. Distribution maps given by all methods: from top to bottom VCA, NMF, MCR-ALS with no previous PCA and MCR-ALS with prior PCA\n\nComparison of endmember spectra given by VCA (in red), NMF (in black), MCR-ALS without PCA (in blue) and MCR-ALS with PCA (in green) of Raman data of Spruce with 5 endmembers and previous background subtraction\n\nAll algorithms were additionally tested on a more heterogeneous plant sample, a cross section of an\n\nstem (named Arabidopsis) whose anatomy is described in Fig.\n\nB. The recorded Raman image comprised different cell wall types: lignified xylem cells, cambium and phloem with primary cell walls. Again, different conditions (baseline correction, number of endmembers) have been tested, mainly by the fast VCA approach. Up to 6 endmembers, relevant pattern and spectra have been revealed and again an influence of background subtraction detected (see Additional file\n\n). Without background subtraction, the middle lamella and cell corners are better defined (EM1) (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1A). The second endmember shows pointwise distribution in the cell corner close to the cambial zone (EM2) with a distinct lignin band at 1634\u00a0cm\n\n(Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1C, red spectrum), pointing to different lignin composition during cell wall formation. After background correction (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1B) this differentiation is less clear and the distribution patterns (EM1, EM2) show stripe-wise artefacts. For these reasons, no background correction was selected for comparison of the three approaches (VCA, NMF, MCR-ALS) on Arabidopsis. The rest of the endmembers are in general very similar and describe carbohydrates (EM3, EM4), proteins and lipids (EM5) and the lumen (EM6). Thus also in this dataset the influence of background subtraction is observed mainly for endmembers involving aromatic cell wall components.\n\nFigures\n\nand\n\nshow the comparison of all abundance maps and their corresponding endmember spectra, respectively, given by the four methods for Arabidopsis without background correction. The different approaches result in similar abundance maps, especially EM1 and EM4 representing the xylem cell corner and compound middle lamella (EM1) and cell wall (EM4). Differences are observed for the other EMs; this time especially NMF is most different from the rest of the methods. NMF yields for EM2 a combination of cell corners and cell wall with a pointwise distribution of the highest intensity, whereas for all the remaining three analyses only the cell corners near the cambial zone are emphasized (Fig.\n\n). Yet all approaches agree in finding a 1633\u00a0cm\n\nband (Fig.\n\n, EM2), which is assigned to C=C of coniferyl alcohol and C=O of coniferyl aldehyde aldehydes in the lignin structure [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n]. While only a shoulder with VCA, the other two (NMF and MCR) end up in a sharp band. NMF shows also cellulose bands (1122, 1094\u00a0cm\n\n) in accordance with the highlighted cell wall in the abundance map. In addition, NMF diverges in the abundance map of EM3, where beside the enhancement of the S1 wall of the xylem, also the primary cell wall (cambium and phloem) is highlighted together with the S1 cell wall layer of the xylem. The corresponding EM3 spectrum shows beside the characteristic cellulose orientation sensitive band at 1095\u00a0cm\n\n, a clear pectin signal at 855\u00a0cm\n\nfor the \u03b1-1,4-glycosidic bond [\n\n] and no contribution in the aromatic regions (black spectrum), whereas the others did. In EM4 the aromatic contribution was different between the approaches [high 1600\u00a0cm\n\nband for VCA, medium for NMF and MCR without PCA, no aromatics and almost pure cellulose for MCR with PCA, (Fig.\n\n)], although the abundance maps are similar for all methods (Fig.\n\n). EM5 presents in all methods material attached to the cell wall, mainly in the phloem part (Fig.\n\n). The EM5 spectra coincide well between all methods (Fig.\n\n) with bands assigned to proteins and lipids (amide III band at 1666\u00a0cm\n\n, CH\n\nand asymmetric CH\n\nbending at 1450\u00a0cm\n\nand phenylalanine at 1005\u00a0cm\n\n) [\n\n\u2013\n\n]. VCA (in red) is the only one having also the aromatic band at 1600\u00a0cm\n\n. In EM6 all methods highlight the lumen, but NMF also the primary cell wall. The two MCR approaches additionally depict further cell wall features i.e. the thick cell wall layer S2 of the interfascicular fibers (in white, Fig.\n\n).\n\nComparison of multivariate methods on raw Raman data of Arabidopsis without previous baseline correction.

The endmember spectra were baseline corrected and each endmember group was normalised against the most intense band (EM1: 1600, EM2: 1600, EM3: 1095, EM4: 1122 and EM5: 1458\u00a0cm\n\n) except for the EM6 due to the lack of a common most intense band\n\nCorrelation coefficients between spectral endmembers (see Additional file\n\n) within the same method are lower than for data set Spruce (see Additional files\n\nand\n\n), ratifying the higher heterogeneity of the sample Arabidopsis. The lowest values are again for MCR with previous PCA, followed by NMF. In the same manner as for data set Spruce, VCA presents the highest correlation values between endmembers. This confirms the finding of the endmember spectra, where VCA showed more mixtures of the different components, whereas NMF and MCR resulted in more \u201cpure\u201d component spectra.\n\nFor all constraints and methods, the correlation coefficient between each VCA and the rest of endmembers given by the other algorithms was calculated prior any pre-processing, and is shown in Additional files\n\n,\n\nand\n\nfor Spruce with 4EM (with and without baseline correction), Spruce with 5EM (with background correction) and Arabidopsis with 6EM (with background subtraction), respectively. The highest correlations match the endmember assignments.\n\nPlant cell walls are highly variable biological materials, which differ in their structure and composition to fulfil different requirements in the living plant [\n\n,\n\n]. In order to assess the suitability of multivariate unmixing methods for the resolution of Raman imaging of plant material in a more general case, data have been acquired on different cell walls of two species. Wooden secondary cell walls of a spruce tree as well as a stem section of\n\nhave been analysed by multivariate analysis approaches. The stem area measured in spruce comprises the thin walled earlywood cells optimized for water transport as well as the thick walled latewood cells, which give the tree mechanical support (Fig.\n\nA). Between these two functional tissues, no differences have been revealed based on the acquired spectra. The stem of\n\nincludes different cell wall types: the phloem (living cells for transport of solutes from the leaves to growing tissues), cambium (dividing cells) and the xylem (dead cells for water transport from the root to the leaves) (Fig.\n\nB), which showed clear differences based on the Raman images. These generated images of plant tissues are well known, which facilitates the interpretation of the data, and also offer a great example for the application of multivariate methods due to the high correlation at the topochemical level (pixels far away might be related) but also at the chemical level (pixel spectra are highly correlated).\n\nMultivariate spectral unmixing analysis describes the input Raman images as a combination of concentration maps and spectral Raman signatures or endmembers (chemical composition) based on several premises and constraints, which might differ to pursue the most appropriate resolution. A summary of all analyses performed and their lack of fit and variance explained by the model is given in Table\n\n. In all cases better statistics (high explained variance, low lack of fit) are achieved by MCR-ALS and NMF approaches compared to VCA. VCA works sequentially and assuming the presence of pure endmembers, unlike NMF or MCR-ALS, which optimize the endmembers simultaneously, balancing the correlation between endmembers and seeking for the highest variance. This simultaneous extraction helps in obtaining components with less correlation among them with the latter two (see Additional files\n\n,\n\nand\n\n). MCR-ALS with PCA filtering delivered often the least correlated endmembers, but sometimes spectral signatures exhibited inverted meaningless bands in the endmember spectra (e.g. Figure\n\n, EM1 and EM4, in green). The results have shown the risk of PCA filtering when small variance contributions are of interest (high rank), since these can be lost in the discarded noise-related principal components.\n\nThe approximate number of endmembers can be determined by taking into account the previous knowledge on the inner variability in the sample (known components) but also by performing singular value decomposition, which factorizes the original data matrix and delivers the eigenvectors, ordered following the amount of variance explained. Since small variance contributions could be mistaken as noise contributions, it is advisable using the unmixing methods with a variable number of components to investigate whether also minor contributions can be modelled in a meaningful way.\n\nFor Spruce, different numbers of endmembers (2, 3, 4 and 5 EMs) were tested for VCA and NMF (see Additional files\n\n,\n\nand\n\n, and Figs.\n\n,\n\n). The results differed mostly at low rank values and is again a consequence of the different way of extracting components: VCA prioritizes extracting the positive endmembers, obtained by sequential orthogonal projections, whereas NMF or MCR-ALS extract simultaneously all components and seek explaining the maximum variance of the data set using a pre-set model size. Therefore, the latter two methods tend to extract preferentially high signal contributions that may account for a higher percentage of variance explained when the rank is too low. This explains that using 2 or 3 endmembers NMF did not include an endmember for the lumen (water), which is a contribution with very low signal intensity, but very different in spectral shape from the rest, while VCA extracted it (see Additional files\n\nand\n\n, top). With higher rank (4, 5, 6) the most severe differences between the methods are always found for the low intensity endmember spectra (Figs.\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). VCA always gives the most correlated endmembers (Additional files\n\n,\n\nand\n\n), but all bands in endmember spectra are biological meaningful, even with high rank. In contrast, the other methods (especially MCR with PCA) may sometimes result in less interpretable spectral shapes in high rank endmember spectra, although often the best model statistics (uncorrelated EM, high explained variance and low lack of fit) are achieved (Table\n\n).\n\nMultivariate analysis of spectroscopic data is influenced by the preprocessing strategy, especially baseline correction. As mentioned before, background subtraction might induce the loss of small features in the data if background differences are related to compositional changes. On the other hand, relevant signal features can be enhanced and differentiation among contributions might become easier after background subtraction. Which side weights more is a matter of method, data set and research question.\n\nThe results given by VCA were quite similar between non- and background subtracted data, for ranks of 2 and 3 endmembers (Additional files\n\nand\n\n, top). For the same rank, NMF shows more differences among background and non-background corrected data (Additional files\n\nand\n\n, bottom), again because of the different way of extracting components. While VCA always has one endmember describing the lumen as most different, NMF reveals already more detailed changes in chemistry and structure. With 3 endmember it is clearly seen that without baseline correction EM2 describes the cell corner with different aromatic structure (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S3A), while with background subtraction a change in cellulose microfibril angle is revealed in the S1 layer (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S3B). This trend of emphasizing either aromatic differences without baseline correction or changes in cellulose microfibril angle after baseline correction is clearly confirmed by all three approaches when 4 endmembers are used for calculation (compare Figs.\n\nand\n\nwith Figs.\n\nand\n\n). The distinct lignin component (Figs.\n\n,\n\n, EM1) found when no background subtraction was applied was replaced by the radial cell wall layer S1 (Figs.\n\n,\n\n, EM2 with cellulose microfibrils parallel to the laser polarization) after the analyses on baseline corrected data. Certainly, the prior EM1 and EM2 (Figs.\n\n,\n\n) was enclosed in the current EM1 as seen by the presence of the pectin band at 856\u00a0cm\n\n(Figs.\n\n,\n\n), which might indicate that a rank of 5EM could be useful for this particular differentiation. Despite background subtraction, VCA was again the single algorithm handing the water in lumen as an endmember (Figs.\n\n,\n\n, EM4) because there is still a residual contribution of this component with a sufficiently distinct shape. For NMF and MCR-ALS this may not happen because the variance due to background contribution is almost totally removed and the methods focus on capturing spectral variations linked to higher percentages of variance. Thus, the 4\n\nendmember did not become alike after pre-processing, but showed for NMF and both MCR-ALS features of the middle lamella with lignin bands at 1140, 1270, 1600 and 1660\u00a0cm\n\n. The ratio between the bands at 1600 and 1660\u00a0cm\n\nof EM4 changed between methods, indicating a different resolution of the ratio of C=C in lignin [\n\n]. MCR-ALS without previous PCA was able to resolve both two types of lignin and the S1 radial cell wall layer and its spectral signature was the most different with the highest 1600/1660 ratio and the additional presence of the shoulder at 1634\u00a0cm\n\n(Fig.\n\n, EM4, in blue).\n\nThe correlation between endmembers within the same method increased and the values were more akin amidst methods [Additional file\n\n: Table S1A (not baseline corrected) and 1B (with prior baseline correction)]. This also clearly shows that variability has been removed by background subtraction. The background subtraction affected differently each method in terms of lack of fit. The lack of fit of the model given by VCA (rank\u2009=\u20094EM) increased when background subtraction was carried out (Table\n\n) because the algorithm still sought the lumen contribution, very different in shape to the rest and now with very low variance. For NMF, the lack of fit decreased substantially, indicating a better performance when background subtraction was applied. For NMF and both MCR-ALS variants, the lack of fit was generally lower because these methods seek the explanation of the maximum variance with a predefined model size.\n\nFor Arabidopsis, the background correction had not so much influence on the resulting endmembers, although this dataset showed more types of cell walls and thus more variability. The VCA analysis with and without background subtraction (Additional file\n\n) resulted in similar abundance maps and spectra using 6 endmembers. After baseline correction some abundance maps showed a striped pattern (especially EM1 and EM2), probably an effect of the noise of the CCD camera [\n\n]. Furthermore, without baseline the cell corners were selectively spotted near the cambial zone, whereas after baseline correction also other tissues have been included. This showed that cell corners near the cambial zone had differed composition (spectral band shoulder at 1634\u00a0cm\n\n) (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1C red spectrum), not seen after baseline correction (Additional file\n\n: Fig. S1D, red spectrum). Based on this information and due to the stripes no previous background subtraction was selected for the final analysis and comparison among methods (Figs.\n\n,\n\n).\n\nThe results on data set Spruce clearly showed that the rank has to be adjusted according to the algorithm and/or background correction. While VCA needed a 5th endmember to resolve the change in aromatics and microfibril orientation, the other approaches revealed these differences after baseline correction already with 4 endmember (Fig.\n\n). This is due to the already discussed fact that VCA always attributes one endmember to describe the watery lumen, while the others do not (details see above). If no baseline correction is done (Fig.\n\n) it becomes absolutely necessary for all methods to use 5EM, if additionally, the change in cellulose microfibril angle in the S1 layer is of interest. In the case of Spruce, for VCA, 5EM with prior background subtraction gave the best results. For the rest of the methods, 4EM with previous background subtraction were enough since the background signal is taken as an offset or in the residuals of the algorithm.\n\nAll analysis showed that the performance of the different methods is dependent on the number of endmembers and the pre-processing strategy and it has to be adapted to every algorithm.\n\nAll unmixing methods revealed in both data sets almost pure lignin spectra from the cell corners and compound middle lamella in-between the cells. Similar like in previous VCA-studies on wooden cell wall [\n\n], additional changes in lignin composition have been revealed, which would be overseen by simple band integration approaches. Cellulose came not as a pure endmember in Spruce, as no pure pixel has been found in this dataset. The analysis of poplar tension wood with Raman microscopy and MCR-ALS [\n\n] could reveal a pure cellulose endmember, as the G-layer with pure cellulose was present. They suggested to work with four endmembers and discarded the rest as not unique. In our 2nd example on Arabidopsis the 6 endmembers delivered by VCA are optimal without baseline correction, as abundance maps display very different anatomical regions and all endmember spectra are interpretable. In all the analysis done so far, the VCA approach always gave the most interpretable spectra, but with the tendency to include more mixtures of different components. NMF and MCR-ALS approaches seem to retrieve the purest (less correlated) EMs, but sometimes include less expected band shapes. Especially MCR-ALS with PCA filtering has more risk of not retrieving subtle differences even choosing more endmembers because of the possible discard of useful information. In these cases, bands less easily interpretable may show up (e.g. Fig.\n\n: green spectrum EM3, Fig.\n\n: green spectrum EM4, Fig.\n\n: green spectrum EM3, EM6). The thin cambial and phloem cells with low Raman intensity are in this example best retrieved by NMF in EM3: clearly visualized in the abundance maps (Fig.\n\n) and with a pectin band in the EM3 spectrum (Fig.\n\n). Nevertheless, a pure pectin spectrum was not revealed in this data set with the current settings, as it is mixed with cellulose in the S1 (high microfibril angle). Analysis of the epidermis of Arabidopsis in a previous VCA analysis revealed clearly a very pure pectin spectrum [\n\n]. On contrary NMF analysis of the cambial cells walls of a carrot root retrieved cellulose together with pectin [\n\n]. By applying a sparse NMF version, which incorporates graph relationship to overcome overlapping problems, spectra of pectin, cellulose and lignin were unmixed from a Raman image of a Longjing tea cell [\n\n]. However, in the latter study, very artificial endmember spectra were found that did not match Raman spectra of reference substances in the literature [\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n].\n\nWith all four unmixing approaches the main trends in plant tissues are found consistently. As discussed above, differences arise in minor or very similar components, due to the factors driving the extraction of components in the different approaches and the general calculated statistics [correlation of endmember (r), lack of fit, explained variances] may vary as well.\n\nThe main differences in the working procedure of the algorithms are:\n\nThe sequential optimization of components in VCA based on a series of orthogonal projections versus the global optimization by NMF and MCR-ALS based on achieving a maximum of variance explained. This makes that NMF and MCR provide generally an overall better description of the image data, with higher variance explained, and a major differentiation of all compounds since they are optimized simultaneously. VCA instead can sometimes point out very small variance contributions linked to components with very distinct spectrum that would need models with higher rank to be found.\n\nThe assumption of closure (sum of abundances equal to 1) in VCA, which is needed for the optimization, is absent in NMF and MCR-ALS. The assumption of this constraint in VCA is an additional element that makes the model fit worse than for NMF and MCR in similar conditions, since a constraint not obeyed by the system is forced to obtain the final solutions.\n\nThe use of a PCA step to set the experimental space in VCA and to do optionally noise-filtering in MCR-ALS, as opposed to NMF and MCR-ALS with no PCA filtering step. This PCA step is, in itself, not questionable, but may have different effects depending on the data set. As a general rule, the PCA step is beneficial since it implies a reduction of noise and helps to a better definition of the experimental space in VCA and a more stable least-squares optimization in MCR. However, it should be taken into account the risk that very subtle spectral differences or very minor contributions may occasionally be sent to the discarded \u2018noise-related\u2019 components and may not be recovered in the final unmixing results. In the case of MCR, an advisable practice is running the algorithm with and without the PCA filtering step to check for the presence of this risk. Or even better, applying more powerful constraints and work, whenever possible, in multiset analysis mode.\n\nIn terms of computation time, VCA is slightly faster than MCR-ALS and no choice of constraints or other tuneable parameters has to be performed. This makes it a suitable method to perform a quick exploration of data sets and may help to select rank. NMF has a computation time significantly higher than MCR-ALS but provides stable solutions if a sufficient number of iterations is allowed. MCR-ALS instead has a reasonable computation time and may allow for accommodating many other powerful constraints other than non-negativity that could help in a better differentiation of similar biological components.\n\nRaman spectroscopic imaging combined with multivariate data analysis gives detailed insights into plant cell wall design. The Raman spectra can be used to differentiate regions different in chemistry as well as in structural organization (cellulose microfibril angle). Even subtle changes in composition and structure are visualized and based on the pure component (endmember) spectra and the related maps, the heterogeneous plant structure can be properly described. In addition, unmixing of Raman plant images offers a step ahead in the definition of completely new tissues, cell or cell layer identification and classification.\n\nAll unmixing methods yield spectral vectors that exhibit signal-to-noise ratios vastly better than those of individual spectra and that describe different components (e.g. lignin, pectin) and/or anatomical regions (e.g. cell wall layers S1, S2). They do not rely on previous knowledge and personal decisions of selecting areas or thresholds for calculating average spectra to describe different plant tissues. Nevertheless, the effect of baseline correction and the number of endmembers have to be taken into account and selected according to the data set, research question and unmixing algorithm. The background signal can be in some cases advantageous since different chemical components generate a different background and, therefore, it can be useful to better differentiate similar components. On the contrary, when background is very dominant, this contribution may hinder the differentiation of subtle spectroscopic features in other relevant bands. Furthermore, the number of components to be resolved should be adapted accordingly in order to obtain the best description of the sample. While for VCA and NMF no baseline correction and up to 6 endmembers revealed interpretable interesting results in the examples presented, MCR-ALS approaches in Raman data of plant cell walls worked better with baseline corrected data and a smaller number of endmembers to describe the data.\n\nCorrelation coefficients between endmembers of each algorithm (VCA, NMF, MCR without previous PCA and with previous PCA) based on 4 endmembers of Spruce (A) without and (B) with prior background (BG) subtraction, ordered in descending order.\n\nCorrelation coefficients between the spectral endmembers generated by the algorithms (with 5 endmembers) for Spruce with previous background subtraction.\n\nInfluence of background subtraction on the Vertex Component Analysis with 6 endmembers on\n\n.

VCA is able to separate the plant material (EM1) and water (EM2) independently of the implementation of background correction. However, the cell wall is included in the water endmember when no baseline correction is applied. NMF by contrary deprecates the water component and the plant material is described by compound middle lamella (EM1) and cell wall (EM2). A rank of 2 is not enough to depict the main features of the plant tissue even after background correction, as NMF does.\n\nVCA (top) and NMF (bottom) analyses of the data set Spruce, without previous background subtraction (A) and with background subtraction (B) with a rank of 3 endmembers.\n\nVCA (top) and NMF (bottom) analyses of the data set Spruce, without previous background subtraction (A) and with background subtraction (B) with a rank of 5 endmembers. For VCA (top), when no background subtraction is applied (A), EM1 shows the inner part of the cell corners whereas EM4 shows the outer cell corners but also part of the main cell wall. EM2 shows the cell wall layer S1 in which the cellulose microfibril orientation is parallel to the laser polarisation. Note the presence of pectin at 854\u00a0cm\n\nin the cell corner in the EM1 and EM4. EM3 marks most of the cell wall (cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin) while EM5 is the lumen filled with water.

    "full_text": "Hypertension affects 26.4% of the global adult population remaining the leading preventable risk factor for premature death and disability worldwide (\n\n,\n\n). Besides the majority of patients with primary (essential) hypertension, a subgroup of ~10% of patients is affected by secondary hypertension. Among the underlying diseases several are of endocrine origin and thyroidal impairments represent an even smaller percentage of the secondary hypertension cases; their incidence and form of presentation varies with age and studied population (\n\n). Hypertension may be the initial clinical presentation for at least 15 endocrine disorders (\n\n), including overt and subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. The correction of thyroid dysfunction may normalize blood pressure (BP) in most cases, therefore checking thyroid function is essential during the workup for hypertension.\n\nThyroid dysfunction, both hypo- and hyperthyroidism may increase the risk of hypertension (\n\n,\n\n). Hypothyroidism should be considered as a graded phenomenon with a wide variety of clinical conditions from subclinical hypothyroidism to myxedema. Subclinical hypothyroidism is a combination of serum thyrotropin (TSH) above the upper reference limit and normal free thyroxine (fT4) and free triiodothyronine (fT3) levels (\n\n). This definition is only applicable in the absence of other acute or chronic recent or ongoing severe illness, assuming a stable thyroid function weeks or more before the evaluation and a normally functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Overt hypothyroidism is characterized by an elevated TSH, usually above 10 mIU/L, in combination with reduced circulating fT4 and fT3 levels.\n\nWhile the most common cause of hypothyroidism had been environmental iodine deficiency for centuries, the situation has changed and the population became iodine sufficient or only mildly deficient. Since then, the leading causes of hypothyroidism are chronic autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITDs). Hashimoto's thyroiditis is 5\u201310 times more common in women than in men, characterized by an increased prevalence with age (\n\n,\n\n). In AITDs the thyroid gland is infiltrated by sensitized T lymphocytes, while circulating thyroid autoantibodies can be detected as a consequence of presumably inherited defect in immune surveillance. Furthermore, hypothyroidism may occur as a consequence of radioiodine or surgical treatment for hyperthyroidism, benign nodular thyroid disease or thyroid cancer, and after external beam radiation for head and neck malignancies. Pharmacological treatment, in most of the cases administration of the iodine-containing antiarrhythmic agent amiodarone, lithium, or immune response modulators, such as interferon alfa can result in the development of thyroiditis and thyroid dysfunction; relatively new iatrogenic causes of hypothyroidism are tyrosine kinase inhibitors and PD-1 inhibitors, sunitinib, and nivolumab, respectively. Sunitinib induces hypothyroidism via reduction of glandular vascularization and induction of type 3 deiodinase enzyme (\n\n,\n\n). The mechanism by which nivolumab impairs the thyroid function is not entirely understood; the explanation might be a reduction in the immune tolerance to normal thyroid tissue antigens (\n\n). Central causes of hypothyroidism are acquired or congenital of origin; pituitary or hypothalamic tumors (including craniopharyngiomas), inflammatory (lymphocytic or granulomatous hypophysitis) or infiltrative diseases, hemorrhagic necrosis (Sheehan's syndrome), or surgical and radiation treatment for pituitary or hypothalamic disease can stay in the background of insufficient production of bioactive TSH (\n\n).\n\nThe reported prevalence rate of overt hypothyroidism is between 0.2 and 5.3% in Europe and 0.3\u20133.7% in the United States, most probably due to the differences in iodine intake (\n\n). The incidence of subclinical hypothyroidism was found to be 7.5% in the Wickham study (\n\n), while in the Colorado study 21% among women and 16% in men, respectively (\n\n). The levels of circulating TSH and antithyroid autoantibodies increase with advancing age; according to the NHANES III data TSH levels above 4.5 mIU/L are present in 14% of the population aged 85 and above (\n\n).\n\nThe most common causes of hyperthyroidism are autoimmune Graves' disease and multinodular goiter. Iatrogenic hyperthyroidism can be a consequence of iodine exposure during administration of iodine-containing drugs among which far the most important is amiodarone, or excess of levothyroxine replacement therapy. Immune response modulator therapy of cancers can lead to hypo- and less frequently hyperthyroidism (\n\n). Subacute thyroiditis is a less frequent cause of hyperthyroidism. Iatrogenic subclinical hyperthyroidism is the declared aim of T4 therapy, and is a relatively frequent condition among patients with differentiated thyroid cancer after near-total thyroidectomy. Further, a few weeks of iatrogenic overt hypothyroidism is an alternative to recombinant TSH administration before radioiodine treatment and during follow-up, in accordance with international guidelines.\n\nThe prevalence of thyrotoxicosis among women is between 0.5 and 2%, a 10-fold female predominance is present. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a condition of mild thyroid hormone excess defined by a serum TSH concentration below the lower reference limit and normal serum fT4 and fT3 concentrations. The same biochemical pattern may describe hypothalamic or pituitary disease, non-thyroidal illness, or the pharmacologic effect of TSH secretion inhibiting drugs. The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism ranges from 0.5 to 6.3%, with the highest established prevalence in individuals over 65 years; approximately half of the affected patients are on levothyroxine substitution (\n\n).\n\nOther relatively common thyroid diseases as multinodular goiter with euthyroidism and differentiated thyroid cancer have sparse impact on the cardiovascular system, and especially, the development of hypertension; however, a recently published meta-analysis found that hypertension significantly increases the risk of development of thyroid cancer (\n\n).\n\nThis review focuses on the common functional thyroid disorders, hypo- and hyperthyroidism that have impact on the cardiovascular system and especially hypertension. The underlying causes of thyroid dysfunction are listed in\n\n.\n\nCauses of thyroid dysfuntions.\n\nTriiodothyronine is the biologically active form of thyroid hormone derived from 5\u2032-monodeiodination of thyroxine in all tissues outside of the thyroid gland, particularly the kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle. The basal metabolic rate is affected by fT3 via altering oxygen consumption, substrate requirements and tissue thermogenesis (\n\n). Thyroid hormones have direct and indirect cellular effects on the cardiovascular system. In hyperthyroidism systemic vascular resistance decreases as fT3 dilates resistance arterioles of the peripheral circulation, which results in the fall of the effective arterial filling followed by stimulation of renin release and activation of the angiotensin-aldosterone axis (\n\n).\n\nPatients with hyperthyroidism present with increased heart rate, increased pulse amplitude, and increased cardiac output by up to 300%, which resembles a state of increased adrenergic activity (\n\n,\n\n), despite normal or low serum concentrations of catecholamines. Other hormonal factors are also affected: the levels of atrial natriuretic peptide, brain natriuretic peptide, endothelin-1 and the vasodilating polypeptide adrenomedullin are elevated in hyperthyroidism (\n\n,\n\n). Thyroid hormone also stimulates erythropoietin secretion. Furthermore, T3 directly increases cardiac contractility, leading to widened pulse pressure (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). The coexistence of ischemic or hypertensive heart disease in a thyroid patient may compromise the ability of the myocardium to respond to the increased metabolic needs in hyperthyroidism and demands caution from the clinician (\n\n).\n\nThe mortality of patients with hyperthyroidism was found to be increased by 20%, and the major causes of death are due to cardiovascular origin (\n\n). The level of cardiac T3, as myocyte intracellular deiodinase activity is not significant, is fundamental in maintaining cardiac morphology and function in adult life via genomic and non-genomic effects. The expression of the main structural and regulatory genes is regulated by T3. Positively regulated genes as \u03b1-myosin heavy chain, sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\n\n-ATPase, \u03b21-adrenergic receptor, atrial natriuretic hormone and voltage-gated potassium channels also contribute to the development of cardiac output increase observed in hyperthyroidism (\n\n). In contrary, the inhibitor of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\n\n-ATPase phospholamban is negatively regulated, as well as the genes of \u03b2-myosin heavy chain, adenylyl cyclase catalytic subunits, Na\n\n/Ca\n\nexchanger and thyroid hormone receptor \u03b11 (\n\n). Non-genomic effects of T3 can develop rapidly in the cardiovascular system not requiring thyroid hormone response element-mediated transcriptional events and altering or modulating the effects of genomic mechanisms (\n\n).\n\nAccording to earlier studies heart failure develops in 6\u201316% of patients with hyperthyroidism. Patients with preexisting hypertension or with risk factors for coronary artery disease have a more pronounced risk for developing hemodynamic changes leading to chronic heart failure. A relatively frequent complication of hyperthyroidism, atrial fibrillation, is an independent predictor for the development of chronic heart failure (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nArterial stiffness is increased in hyperthyroidism (\n\n) due to the effect of thyroxin on vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells via genomic and non-genomic action targeting membrane ion channels and endothelial nitric oxide synthesis (\n\n). In addition, the Calcium/ Calmodulin-dependent kinase IV (CaMKIV), which is known to be a major thyroid hormone target gene during brain development, plays an important role in blood pressure regulation through the control of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOC) activity (\n\n\u2013\n\n).\n\nThe hemodynamic effects of hypothyroidism are opposite to those of hyperthyroidism, although the clinical manifestations are less obvious with bradycardia being the most common sign accompanied by mild hypertension and a narrowed pulse pressure. Bradycardia, decreased ventricular filling and cardiac contractility together lead to low cardiac output. An increase in the systemic vascular resistance and slowed ventricular diastolic relaxation and filling are present. The decreased metabolic rate leads to a decline in peripheral oxygen demand, consequently heart failure is a rare clinical manifestation of hypothyroidism (\n\n). Elevated diastolic blood pressure is present in ~30% of patients with overt hypothyroidism. Cardiac contractility and output decreases leading to a narrowed pulse pressure. In hypothyroidism renin release is decreased with an increased salt sensitivity. The consequent renal sodium reabsorption leads to an expansion of blood volume by 5.5% (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n).\n\nWe have previously shown that in patients who had undergone thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer, increased aortic stiffness and impaired diastolic function can be detected during induced overt hypothyroidism, which is part of the diagnostic follow-up procedure (\n\n).\n\nSeveral clinical data suggest that autoimmune thyroid disease may be responsible for the development of primary pulmonary hypertension in both hyper- and hypothyroidism; therefore in pulmonary hypertension (PH) thyroid function should be evaluated (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nThe effects of the functional thyroid disorders on the cardiovascular system leading to hypertension are summarized in\n\n.\n\nEffects of functional thyroid disorders on the cardiovascular system leading to hypertension.\n\nWhile a normal TSH and consequently fT4 and fT3 within the physiological range are essential in growth, differentiation and maintenance of adequate function of all human organs, several genetic defects have been evaluated and described in the route of thyroid hormone signaling during the past decade, including those with mutations in thyroid hormone transporters and receptors (\n\n). According to novel studies, even minor changes in the thyroid hormone levels can affect bone mineral density (\n\n), mental status (\n\n), and can also lead to impaired metabolism (\n\n), and increased cardiovascular risk (\n\n). While the levels of the serum thyroid hormones show marked inter-individual variability, there is no significant intra-individual variability, as TSH values change very little during time (\n\n). Based on these results a conclusion can be made that each individual has a unique thyroid set-point, defined by genetic and environmental factors such as iodine intake and smoking (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nThe genetic pattern of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis involves numerous genes with rare high-penetrance variants and common low-penetrance forms, mutations and polymorphisms, respectively. Several mutations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis were described to date and found responsible for impaired thyroid function (\n\n,\n\n). A large number of new genes were identified during the last decade that affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, some of which are responsible for thyroid dysfunction and consequently affect different organs and present risk factors for the development of different diseases, including hypertension.\n\nThyroid dysfunction is rarely attributed to single gene mutations. Numerous studies were performed in the last 2 years to reveal genetic variants presenting with polymorphisms associated with thyroid impairment and altered function. These encompass both linkage and candidate gene analyses targeting the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid pathway. A detailed overview of genes affecting the thyroid axis is found elsewhere (\n\n). A few polymorphisms were found to be associated with blood pressure; however, the results remain controversial. A couple of type II iodothyronine deiodinase (DIO2) gene mutations were found to cause hypertension in middle-aged patients with euthyroidism (\n\n). Interestingly, these variants did not cause any changes in the circulating TSH or free thyroid hormone levels (\n\n,\n\n). These results were not confirmed by other clinical studies (\n\n,\n\n). A mutation in the thyrotropin releasing hormone receptor gene was characterized to be associated with an increased risk of essential high blood pressure (\n\n). The findings regarding gene mutations affecting blood pressure values remain controversial and need further evaluation.\n\nHyperthyroidism is accompanied by cardiovascular complications (cardiac arrhythmias, hypercoagulopathy, stroke, and pulmonary embolism) in a significant number of cases, leading to an increase in short-term morbidity and long-term morbidity and mortality. Brandt et al. found a significant 20% increase in mortality in patients with hyperthyroidism in their meta-analysis based on seven studies (\n\n).\n\nThe excess of T3 leads to metabolic and hemodynamic changes: metabolic rate, cardiac preload, and ventricular contractility increases while systemic vascular resistance decreases, causing an increased cardiac output and hypertension, as discussed above.\n\nThe highest risk of coronary heart disease mortality and atrial fibrillation is noted when serum TSH is below 0.10 mIU/l (\n\n).\n\nHemodynamic changes affect not only the left cardiac output, since pulmonary hypertension may also be present in patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves-disease or nodular goiter (\n\n). Pulmonary hypertension was found to be the most common complication in a study which investigated hyperthyroid patients by echocardiography (\n\n). The prevalence of pulmonary hypertension was detected to be relatively high among hyperthyroid patients, varying between 36 and 65%, although mild and asymptomatic cases were found to be the most common (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nIn the pharmacological treatment of systolic secondary hypertension caused by hyperfunction of the thyroid gland, besides reaching euthyroidism, non-selective beta-blockers are often preferred, for controlling the concomitant tachycardia and tremor effectively and blocking the peripheral T4 to T3 conversion (\n\n).\n\nThe increased cardiovascular mortality among patients with hyperthyroidism may be as well the consequence of shared genetic or environmental factors, based on the pronounced familial aggregation of hyperthyroidism, cardiovascular disease, lifespan, and smoking habits (\n\n).\n\nOur group previously found that there is an increase in the aortic stiffness in combination with decreased diastolic function in patients with subclinical hyperthyroidism on levothyroxine suppression therapy after total thyroidectomy due to differentiated thyroid cancer (\n\n).\n\nA study found that patients with hyperthyroidism and normal blood pressure during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) had higher systolic blood pressure than euthyroid normotensive participants. The successful treatment of hyperthyroidism resulted in normalization of systolic blood pressure. The nocturnal decrease in blood pressure did not differ from that of normal subjects (\n\n).\n\nIn a recently published study Lillevang-Johansen et al. investigated the association between hyperthyroidism and the occurrence of cardiovascular (CV) events among treated and untreated hyperthyroid patients (\n\n). The real-world data of this study revealed the impact of varying thyroid status on cardiovascular events: untreated and insufficiently treated hyperthyroid patients had increased cardiovascular risk. According to the data of more than 275,000 individuals followed-up for hyperthyroidism, sufficiently controlled thyrotoxicosis did not increase cardiovascular risk. After an adjustment for main cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia, the findings were not significantly affected, suggesting that elevated thyroid hormone levels are playing a major role in the increase of CV risk (\n\n). These findings suggest that careful monitoring of treatment and maintaining euthyroidism is fundamental in the prevention of CV events among patients with hyperthyroidism.\n\nSubclinical hyperthyroidism is defined as a subnormal serum TSH value accompanied by T4 and T3 within the normal reference range. The change in thyroid function needs to be evaluated and confirmed by a second laboratory measurement after 3\u20136 months (\n\n). The prevalence of subclinical hyperthyroidism can be detected more frequently in iodine depleted areas and increases with advancing age (\n\n). According to the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) 0.7% of 16,533 people were reported to have subclinical hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.1 mU/L); these subjects were not taking thyroid medication (\n\n). Subclinical hyperthyroidism can be classified into two categories: Grade 1, with a mild decrease of serum TSH (0.1\u20130.4 mIU/L), and Grade 2, with a more marked TSH decrease (TSH below 0.1 mIU/L) (\n\n).\n\nThe long exposure of the heart to subclinical hyperthyroidism leads to an altered cardiac morphology and function. As a consequence, left ventricular function changes: systolic function is enhanced, while diastolic function becomes impaired, a slowed myocardial relaxation is present resulting in an increase of left ventricular mass (\n\n); as well as increased heart rate and arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation (\n\n).\n\nAlthough lipid profile is not affected unfavorably in subclinical hyperthyroidism, endothelial dysfunction and increased thrombogenicity is present (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n).\n\nA meta-analysis with more than 25,000 participants proved that subclinical hyperthyroidism is associated with increased risk of coronary artery disease events and coronary artery disease mortality, and also with elevated total mortality. The risk for mortality due to coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation was more prominent in Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism (\n\n).\n\nIn the Rotterdam study involving more than 9,000 participants, the risk of cardiovascular mortality increased in a linear manner with subclinical hyperthyroidism and free T4 levels close to the upper limit of the reference range compared to those with free T4 levels close to the lower limit (\n\n). A large systematic review with data from more than 70,000 people found that subclinical hyperthyroidism was associated with an increased risk of total mortality, heart failure, atrial fibrillation and coronary artery disease mortality in patients with Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism (\n\n).\n\nBesides these changes in the cardiovascular risk due to subclinical hyperthyroidism, prospective cohort studies failed to show significant association between subclinical hyperthyroidism and hypertension (\n\n,\n\n). Due to the increased risk for the development of cardiovascular diseases and mortality, there is a wide agreement among specialists that treatment of patients with Grade 2 subclinical hyperthyroidism should be initiated (\n\n).\n\nThyroid hormones affect biochemical and molecular mechanisms of lipid homeostasis resulting in a variable phenomenon of dyslipidemia (\n\n) mostly characterized by high serum concentrations of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and normal or even elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Furthermore, high serum concentrations of triglycerides, intermediate-density lipoproteins, apolipoprotein A and apolipoprotein B are frequently observed (\n\n\u2013\n\n). The primary mechanism in the background of hypercholesterolemia is the accumulation of LDL cholesterol due to reduction in the number and activity of the cell-surface LDL receptors resulting in decreased hepatic LDL catabolism. In addition to the direct effect of T3 on the promoter region of the LDL receptor gene, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SERBP-2) gene is also regulated by T3, resulting in the altered transcription of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and LDL receptor genes (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n). Thyroid hormones also increase the activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein, hepatic lipase, lipoprotein lipase, and lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (\n\n,\n\n). Although a substantial number of studies indicated a beneficial response in patients with TSH levels between 2.5 and 4.5 concerning atherosclerosis risk factors such as atherogenic lipid parameters, impaired endothelial function, and intima media thickness (\n\n,\n\n), TSH has no defined cutoff threshold regarding cardiovascular prevention and atherosclerosis (\n\n).\n\nA study of more than 30,000 patients showed similar results: increased LDL, non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides and decreased HDL with high-normal TSH levels still in the reference range (\n\n). Since the thyroid hormones have known regulatory effect on the lipid metabolism and consequently on blood pressure, their impact on the cardiovascular system may be partially explained by these mechanisms (\n\n,\n\n). Another large prospective study involving more than 14,000 participants with normal TSH levels at start and followed for 11 years found that high-normal TSH levels were predictive for moderately higher blood pressure in the future. Moreover, 1 mU/L elevation in the TSH values resulted in about 2 mmHg elevation in the systolic blood pressure, 1\u20132 mmHg increase in the diastolic blood pressure and 0.1 mmol/L rise in non-HDL cholesterol and triglyceride values (\n\n).\n\nHypothyroidism being one of the most common secondary causes of dyslipidemia (\n\n) is clearly associated with an increased risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease owing to its metabolic and hemodynamic effects (\n\n). Atherosclerosis develops in patients with hypothyroidism as a consequence of multiple mechanisms including hyperlipidemia, hypercoagulable state, endothelial dysfunction and increased arterial stiffness which leads to arterial hypertension (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nThe atherogenic lipid changes in hypothyroidism, similarly to the ones in BP values, appear to develop rapidly, as seen in individuals with a hypothyroidism only 3 weeks following thyroidectomy due to non-toxic multinodular goiter (\n\n). Even low normal fT4 concentrations have been associated with a more atherogenic lipid profile (\n\n). In a study involving more than 5,000 participants a significant association has been described between LDL, total cholesterol and TSH levels ranging 3.5\u201310 mU/L (\n\n). Total cholesterol and LDL levels decreased in a crossover study after 100 \u03bcg levothyroxine supplementation of the subjects having TSH values greater than 6.1 mU/L (\n\n). The same result was observed in another study conducted among individually substituted patients with TSH greater than 8 mU/L (\n\n,\n\n).\n\nBesides dyslipidemia, changes in coagulation parameters are described in thyroid disorders being partly responsible for atherogenic changes. Decreased platelet count, aggregation and agglutination, von Willebrand factor antigen and activity, decreased levels of several coagulation factors such as factor VII, VIII, IX, XI, and plasminogen activator-1 can be detected in overt hypothyroidism leading to hypercoagulability. In subclinical hypothyroidism and autoimmune thyroid disease increased fibrinogen level, factor VII level and activity, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 level have been detected rendering a tendency toward a hypercoagulable state (\n\n,\n\n). The mechanisms underlying the development of the changes in coagulation parameters in hypothyroidism are not well understood. A possible explanation might be the direct effect of the thyroid hormones. However, it is still unclear whether the thyroid hormone deficiency or the elevated TSH levels, or both, are responsible for the alteration in the coagulation parameters (\n\n).\n\nFurthermore, the association between hypothyroidism and defects in the secretion of endothelium-dependent dilation factors is well known (\n\n,\n\n). Endothelial cell TSH receptor induces multiple effects including the down-regulation of anti-inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukine-6, in addition to the induction of angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor, VEGF), and leukocyte adhesion (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin). Elevated expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules is related to endothelial dysfunction, which is believed to be an early step in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Assessment of endothelial dysfunction, as an early biomarker, is helpful in predicting cardiovascular risk and evaluating the outcome of treatment (\n\n). Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery is a functional test of the capacity of increased blood flow provoked by the release of endothelial NO and other vasodilator mediators, following induced ischemia, therefore, is an accepted early method for non-invasive assessment of systemic endothelial function (\n\n). Flow-mediated dilation was found to be impaired not only in patients with mild hypothyroidism but also in subjects with \u201chigh-normal\u201d serum TSH levels (\n\n). Another study also reported that patients with subclinical hypothyroidism had significantly lower flow-mediated dilation values (\n\n).\n\nDespite the above mentioned data, the association of subclinical hypothyroidism and atherosclerosis is still debated, although hyperlipidemia is usually present (\n\n,\n\n). Carotid artery intima-media thickness measurement remains a long-standing and reliable diagnostic modality used to assess vascular morbidity at an early stage (\n\n). A recent study revealed that carotid artery intima-media thickness is significantly higher in patients with both overt and subclinical hypothyroidism compared with normal control subjects (\n\n).\n\nCentral arterial stiffness is positively associated with systolic hypertension, coronary artery disease, stroke, and heart failure, which are the leading causes of mortality in developed countries. Central arterial stiffening or reduced arterial compliance leads to augmented central blood pressure, increased cardiac afterload, and is an independent predictor of cardiac events (\n\n). A previous study confirmed that hypothyroidism is associated with increased augmentation of central aortic pressure and central arterial stiffness. Furthermore, these abnormalities are reversed after adequate T4 replacement (\n\n). Arterial stiffness was also increased in subclinical hypothyroidism and improved with L-thyroxine treatment (\n\n).\n\nThe above detailed impairment in the lipid metabolism due to hypothyroidism may contribute to the development or progression of hypertension. In addition, patients affected by hypothyroidism may have other concomitant cardiovascular diseases and consequently their summed effect on the blood pressure may be even more accentuated.\n\nA high prevalence of diastolic hypertension had been found in patients above 50 years of age with overt hypothyroidism whose blood pressure was normalized after adequate thyroid hormone replacement therapy (\n\n). However, hypothyroidism as a cause of hypertension is often overlooked. In an early study Saito et al. found a 3-fold higher prevalence of diastolic hypertension in hypothyroidism than in age-matched patients without thyroid disorder using the World Health Organization's (WHO) earlier used criteria for hypertension, namely blood pressure > 160/95 mmHg (\n\n,\n\n). According to the current ESC guidelines for the treatment of hypertension, in-office systolic blood pressure (SBP) values \u2265 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values \u2265 90 mmHg define hypertension based on evidence from multiple randomized clinical trials proving that treatment of patients with these BP values is beneficial (\n\n).\n\nMasked hypertension, defined as a normal in-office blood pressure in spite of higher values detected during an active day, can be found during evaluation via ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM); masked hypertension is present in ~15% of untreated patients. The prevalence of this condition is greater among younger men, who are affected by higher levels of anxiety and job stress. Furthermore, habits like smoking, alcohol consumption and more pronounced physical activity are more common among them (\n\n). Recently published data has suggest that many individuals with masked hypertension present with a higher left ventricular mass index, therefore a higher cardiovascular risk, in the detection of which ABPM seems more efficient than HBPM (\n\n). In a recently published pilot study, the occurrence of masked hypertension was evaluated among patients with overt and subclinical hypothyroidism using 24-h ABPM; a significantly higher prevalence of masked hypertension was found in both groups compared to controls with euthyroidism, which suggests the existence of elevated cardiovascular risk in hypothyroidism, especially in young male patients with autoimmune thyroiditis (\n\n).\n\nPositive association of serum TSH levels with arterial blood pressure was demonstrated through a cross-sectional analysis of pooled data from five population-based studies in adults (\n\n). The association was present in the full range of TSH and even within the reference range, while positive correlation was limited to prevalent hypertension, and not in a 5-year change of blood pressure or incident hypertension (\n\n). In patients who underwent thyroid surgery due to differentiated thyroid cancer and had overt hypothyroidism before radioiodine therapy, an elevation in nocturnal systolic, mean and diastolic blood pressure was found; also, an increased number of non-dippers were found among these subjects (\n\n).\n\nHypothyroidism has been generally considered as a cardiovascular risk factor, as discussed above, stressing the need of routine screening for thyroid function especially among female patients with coronary heart disease or patients with known cardiovascular risk factors (\n\n). Subclinical hypothyroidism is a common entity, characterized by elevated TSH-levels and fT4 and fT3 levels in the normal range.\n\nThe association between elevated blood pressure and overt thyroid disorders has been thoroughly investigated and well-established, while the question whether subclinical changes in the thyroid function present potential risk for the development and maintenance of hypertension are still under debate. Some studies detected positive correlations of subclinical hypothyroidism and hypertension in women (\n\n,\n\n); however, the same results were not confirmed in men (\n\n,\n\n). A number of clinical studies assessed the relationship between subclinical thyroid dysfunction, both hypo and hyperthyroidism, and endothelial dysfunction (\n\n), arterial wall thickening (\n\n,\n\n,\n\n), atrial fibrillation (\n\n), and left ventricular hypertrophy (\n\n). A study involving more than 10.000 children and adolescents found a positive correlation between elevated serum TSH levels and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure; however, this correlation was not established with hypertension (\n\n). Upon these findings, one can presume an association between subclinical hypothyroidism and elevated risk for the development of hypertension.\n\nIn a large, population-based study with more than 30,000 participants the thyrotropin levels within the normal range were significantly correlated with the arterial blood pressure and hypertension as well in both genders; however, TSH levels above the upper limit presented positive association in women only (\n\n). One possible explanation for this discrepancy may be that TSH levels were measured only in half of the male participants and 100% of female patients. Furthermore, these inconsistent data may also be affected by the iodine intake of the studied population; the range of TSH level may differ upon the iodine supply of the studied region (\n\n). Studies that were conducted in regions with iodine excess like Far East Asia failed to find any correlation between blood pressure and TSH values within the normal range; these regions have higher thyrotropin reference range limits (\n\n,\n\n). On the contrary, several studies performed in regions characterized by mild to moderate iodine deficiency or even sufficient iodine intake showed a positive correlation between TSH level and blood pressure values (\n\n,\n\n). The differences observed in the results, however, may be partially due to the higher prevalence of hypertension in Far East Asia compared to Europe and the alternate screening and treatment methods used in these regions (\n\n).\n\nOverall, the data from several studies and pooled analyses suggest that the correlation between high serum thyrotropin levels and blood pressure changes might be time-dependent and cannot predict the further development of hypertension and might occur only during an actual TSH elevation (\n\n).\n\nIn a recently published meta-analysis the effect of levothyroxine replacement therapy on blood pressure in subclinical hypothyroidism was investigated. The summed results of 10 randomized clinical trials showed that after levothyroxine therapy systolic blood pressure was reduced significantly. A subgroup analysis suggested that the systolic blood pressure lowering effect was more accentuated in patients with higher TSH levels. In 19 prospective follow-up studies both systolic and diastolic blood pressure values decreased significantly after levothyroxine initiation (\n\n).\n\nAlterations of thyroid function may result in changes in blood pressure values as well as other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, leading to an increased cardiovascular risk, which is mild in most cases, although hyperthyroidism represents a significant elevation of cardiovascular mortality risk. The delayed clinical recognition of subclinical forms of thyroid dysfunction, i.e., subclinical hypo and hyperthyroidism has unfavorable cardiovascular effects. Available data suggest that, concerning cardiovascular risks, early diagnosis, and treatment of even mild forms of functional thyroid disorders might be beneficial in the vast majority of the patients. However, overtreatment should be avoided, and age-related or individual variances of pituitary-thyroid set-points have to be respected.\n\nAll authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication.\n\nThe authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.\n\n"
