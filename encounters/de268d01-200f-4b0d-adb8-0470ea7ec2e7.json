Blood glucose readings at home have been ranging from 120-180 mg/dL. Patient reports occasional mild headaches, 2-3 times per week, typically in the afternoon. Describes them as dull, pressure-like pain across the forehead, rating them 3/10 in severity, lasting about 2-3 hours and sometimes relieved with OTC acetaminophen.
